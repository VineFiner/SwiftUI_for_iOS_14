00:00:00.715 --> 00:00:03.048
(whooshing)

2
00:00:06.652 --> 00:00:09.235
(upbeat music)

3
00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:13.760
<v Meng>Hi, my name is Meng</v>

4
00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.390
I'm from Design+Code,

5
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:19.620
and welcome to my SwiftUI course for iOS 14.

6
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.250
For the first time ever,

7
00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.250
we're going to build a multi-platform app for iOS, iPadOS,

8
00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.300
and macOS using only SwiftUI,

9
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.640
and the same techniques

10
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.410
and minimal code change,

11
00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:33.243
you're gonna be able

12
00:00:33.243 --> 00:00:36.420
to make your code work across platforms.

13
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.660
Starting with iOS,

14
00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.600
we're going to embrace the sidebar navigation,

15
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.160
which means that this translate well to the Mac App.

16
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.380
For the iPhone, we're going to use the tab bar,

17
00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.240
which is really good for navigation and adaptive layout

18
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.270
so you can easily switch between landscape mode

19
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.020
and portrait mode, and your layout will still look great.

20
00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.480
The sidebar allows you to have a lot of navigation items.

21
00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.750
But also you can toggle between, on and off.

22
00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.830
And because we're using the new Lazy Grid,

23
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.700
we're gonna be able to make our layout adaptive.

24
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.040
So the bigger the screen,

25
00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.290
the more columns we can have.

26
00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.930
We're also going to use the new Matched Geometry Effect,

27
00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.870
which allows you to transition between views.

28
00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:21.770
And for the new view,

29
00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.430
you can have scrolling,

30
00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.830
and more navigation such as the modal

31
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.210
all of these animations will work on all platforms,

32
00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.300
such as the iPad, and in this case,

33
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.480
we're able to put it on top of the sidebar.

34
00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.340
But if not, we can also have a different type of animation

35
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.760
that exists within its own container.

36
00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.310
And thanks to the Lazy Grid,

37
00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:43.380
we're gonna be able to switch

38
00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.440
between modes such as this

39
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.320
and apply some 3D animation, as we scroll.

40
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.360
At the same time,

41
00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.440
the transition will still work and you will have scrolling

42
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.900
as well as the modal behavior.

43
00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.080
These animations will also adapt perfectly to the device.

44
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.290
So for the iPhone, we're gonna have a single column

45
00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.683
and the cards will stack more closely.

46
00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.430
Then we're gonna learn more animations.

47
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:11.610
So in this case, we're gonna stack the cards like this.

48
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.222
And you can flip the card and have

49
00:02:14.222 --> 00:02:17.033
that animation for each of the card.

50
00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.640
Again, it's going to work for the iPhone as well.

51
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.870
And we're gonna make it adapt

52
00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.350
to the screen size with transition.

53
00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.940
Using the accent color and the preset colors,

54
00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.770
your app will automatically adapt for dark mode,

55
00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.920
and there's no code change.

56
00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.720
Likewise, for the Mac, you can switch to light mode,

57
00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.940
and it will still look great with the translucent menu

58
00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.830
and the accent color.

59
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.646
Since we're using dynamic type,

60
00:02:42.646 --> 00:02:46.150
the text will translate perfectly depending on the platform.

61
00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.730
So for example, on the Mac,

62
00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.810
it's going to be slightly smaller,

63
00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.450
and the modal is going to look like this.

64
00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.370
It can be bigger as well.

65
00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.670
And we can have multiple site navigation

66
00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.890
and the grid layout as well as the padding

67
00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.880
and round corners will adapt to the platform.

68
00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:03.713
So in this course,

69
00:03:03.713 --> 00:03:05.070
we're gonna look at different types

70
00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.470
of navigation such as the default one,

71
00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.090
which can go very deep.

72
00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.740
And works across platform,

73
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.710
we can have multilevel menus,

74
00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:16.120
or depending on content,

75
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.000
we can go with a modal route,

76
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.790
and it can go as deep as you want.

77
00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.250
We will also prototype custom animations such as this,

78
00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.180
and be able to use static data, so you can search

79
00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.100
and easily filter.

80
00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.370
We're also going to build a widget together

81
00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.950
so that we can showcase key content on the home screen.

82
00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.390
Finally, we're gonna learn how to structure our app

83
00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.260
in terms of files, folders and assets.

84
00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.030
So with this, I hope you're excited

85
00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.280
to build your first iOS 14 app.

86
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.050
In order to follow this course you're going

87
00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.120
to need Xcode 12.

88
00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.430
So go to www.developer.apple.com

89
00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.420
and then you can find Xcode 12.

90
00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.300
And at the bottom of the page,

91
00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.270
you will find download Xcode 12.

92
00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:00.860
This is where you're going to log in with your Apple ID,

93
00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.320
it doesn't have to be a paid membership

94
00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.270
in the Beta download page,

95
00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:07.120
you're gonna go to applications

96
00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.490
and download Xcode 12 beta 2.

97
00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:14.490
Now SwiftUI has been pretty stable over the past 10 months.

98
00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.930
So even if you're on a new beta, it should be working fine.

99
00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.560
But I will be providing the source files for each beta.

100
00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.980
So after you download this,

101
00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.150
I highly recommend that you download macOS Big Sur.

102
00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.510
If you wanna be able to test the Mac App

103
00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.830
and develop for macOS, you will need Big Sur.

104
00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.870
But otherwise, if you only wanna focus on iOS and iPad,

105
00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.480
the lessons provided and the code should be working fine.

106
00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.700
However, there might be some inconsistencies.

107
00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.060
But I do wanna point out that from my experience,

108
00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.970
and from the comments that I've read,

109
00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:48.830
Big Sur is very stable.

110
00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.480
However, when you install it,

111
00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.940
you should definitely backup, partition,

112
00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.200
or simply install on the non production machine.

113
00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.580
The source files are provided from section two

114
00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.090
or in the download section of www.designcode.io.

115
00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.890
Here, you will find the source files for the final app

116
00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:10.550
that I've shown you and for each section of the course,

117
00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.580
so that you can compare your code against mine.

118
00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.180
Also, please make sure to re download the files

119
00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.390
whenever you have a newer beta,

120
00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:20.290
and I will do my best to update the code

121
00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.590
if there is any breaking change.

122
00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.540
I also provided the design template,

123
00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:28.190
so you can definitely look into how I organize my design

124
00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:33.190
for iOS for iPad, and as well for the icons.

125
00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.490
This is also a great template for your app.

126
00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.990
So you can put your app icon in a component

127
00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.030
and it will automatically update all of these icons,

128
00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:45.560
so that you can export with the correct names

129
00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.890
and resolutions.

130
00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:49.280
As you design for the Apple platforms,

131
00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.600
you should download the SF Pro fonts for iOS,

132
00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.870
iPadOS and tvOS,

133
00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:59.350
SF Compact for watchOS, SF mono which is optional,

134
00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:01.460
but great for code highlighting,

135
00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:04.020
and New York which is a serif typeface.

136
00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:05.710
Finally for the icons,

137
00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:09.310
you should download the SF Symbols app from Apple.

138
00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:11.570
And here you're gonna click on SF Symbols

139
00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:15.500
to find the beta for SF Symbols 2

140
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:20.480
the new SF Symbols 2 has over 2400 icons

141
00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.560
in different stroke width.

142
00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.743
And also, you can have multicolor now,

143
00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:28.870
to use these icons in SwiftUI,

144
00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:31.010
you don't need to import anything,

145
00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:33.530
you can just put the name of the icon

146
00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:35.280
into the SwiftUI code.

147
00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.300
All right, so let's get started.

148
00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:38.840
Now we're gonna open Xcode.

149
00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.870
And here we're gonna create a new Xcode project.

150
00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:44.810
Here, we're gonna go to multi platform

151
00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:48.290
click on App and click on Next.

152
00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:51.840
We're going to name it Design Code Course.

153
00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:54.030
And then click on Next.

154
00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:58.320
Let's save that to downloads with Creating Git repository

155
00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:59.910
on my Mac enabled.

156
00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:01.430
Then click on Create.

157
00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:05.220
Now you have in front of you a new Xcode project,

158
00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:06.840
you can double click on the tab bar

159
00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:08.300
to maximize it.

160
00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:12.030
Now we have the navigator on the left side with shared,

161
00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:14.900
which is for both iOS and macOS code.

162
00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:19.010
But also you can have platform specific code for iOS

163
00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:21.600
and macOS, which I will explain later.

164
00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.240
But for now, we're going to focus on shared

165
00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:27.018
and we will make sure that our code will work

166
00:07:27.018 --> 00:07:28.870
on all platforms.

167
00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:31.320
So in the past SwiftUI projects,

168
00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:33.710
we had the App delegate.swift file,

169
00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:37.860
but now this has been replaced by DesignCodeCourse App,

170
00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:40.410
which is referencing to content view

171
00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:43.110
and content view is your first screen.

172
00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:45.440
We'll come back to this in the next session.

173
00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:48.260
But for now, we're gonna set up the assets

174
00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.130
in Xcode 12, we have the accent color now,

175
00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:55.260
which is a single color that will tint your app text buttons

176
00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.390
as well as the navigation selected states.

177
00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:01.670
Now it is recommended to have have appearances

178
00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:03.840
for both light and dark.

179
00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:04.900
So in light mode,

180
00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:07.010
it's going to be slightly darker,

181
00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:09.250
which makes the contrast better.

182
00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:11.310
And likewise for dark mode,

183
00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:14.180
the color is going to be lighter for better contrast.

184
00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:15.640
For the App Icon,

185
00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:17.330
It's exactly as before,

186
00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:20.570
except now we have a Mac section.

187
00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:21.740
This part is optional,

188
00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:24.400
since I already prepared the assets for you.

189
00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.110
If you wanna create a custom icon,

190
00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:27.950
I prepared this template in Figma.

191
00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:31.070
And you can just update the component

192
00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:33.330
and then you can export the file.

193
00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:35.360
So we're gonna put it in downloads,

194
00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.890
and then all you need to do is to select

195
00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:42.370
all the iPhone assets and drag and drop right here

196
00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:44.750
where you see all the blue squares.

197
00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:46.730
Since this can be a bit time consuming

198
00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:48.780
to make sure that all the resolutions are correct

199
00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:51.000
and all the colors, are correct for both light

200
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:51.950
and dark mode,

201
00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:53.900
I prepared this part for you.

202
00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:58.440
So we're just gonna replace it by deleting both the App Icon

203
00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:00.360
and the accent color.

204
00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:05.070
We're gonna go to the assets folder to find assets.

205
00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:08.000
And here on all of these folders,

206
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.583
we're just gonna drag and drop directly to this space here.

207
00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:15.000
As I mentioned before,

208
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.610
we have accent color for light mode and dark mode.

209
00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:24.530
And then the App Icon we have for iPhone, iPad, and Mac,

210
00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:26.380
as well as the App Store.

211
00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:30.380
Then I set up a bunch of colors that we can use for the app.

212
00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:32.870
So here, you can navigate it like this,

213
00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:34.580
or you can go to the folders

214
00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:36.610
and you can find the different colors.

215
00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:39.800
So background, one to five primary secondary

216
00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:42.031
for both light mode and dark mode.

217
00:09:42.031 --> 00:09:44.214
And then we have a bunch of images,

218
00:09:44.214 --> 00:09:47.080
which can be in SVG format.

219
00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:51.610
So previously, we could only use PDF as well as PNG.

220
00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:54.280
But now we can also use SVG

221
00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:58.930
for icons and vector illustrations SVG is great.

222
00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:02.960
For images that is a mix of vector and bitmap,

223
00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:06.650
as well as complex gradients or masking,

224
00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:08.320
I recommend PDF.

225
00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:09.950
If you want pixel perfection,

226
00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:12.630
but at a cost of large file size,

227
00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:14.470
you can definitely use PNG.

228
00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:16.920
And if it doesn't have transparency,

229
00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:18.293
then you can use JPEG.

230
00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:21.300
Otherwise, don't worry too much about these

231
00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:24.100
because these assets are already prepared for you.

232
00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:26.160
And we'll learn as we go.

233
00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:27.930
Now we're gonna to go to the Content View,

234
00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:30.840
and we can finally start coding in SwiftUI.

235
00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:31.673
So I'll see you,

236
00:10:31.673 --> 00:10:33.023
in the next session.

237
00:10:33.023 --> 00:10:34.806
