00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,530
- [Meng] Hi, Welcome to a second session,

3
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:16,180
of my SwiftUI course.

4
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:17,013
In this session,

5
00:00:17,013 --> 00:00:19,940
we're going to learn how to
create a very basic cart design

6
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:23,740
using SwiftUI new visual editing tools.

7
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:25,540
Now the first thing we're going to do

8
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:28,150
is to resume our preview.

9
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:30,050
This might take a couple minutes

10
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:32,600
if you're doing it for the first time.

11
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,840
And so when it's loaded,

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,290
this is a visual representation
of your code here.

13
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:38,700
And the device itself

14
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,790
can be changed by going
to the device list here.

15
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:45,980
We can change that for iOS 11 Pro.

16
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:48,710
And so today, we're not even
going to touch the code at all.

17
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:51,670
We're just gonna click on the elements

18
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:53,520
and then go to the inspector,

19
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,820
and this is where you can customize

20
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,310
your elements appearance.

21
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:59,350
Now the inspector has a bunch of tabs,

22
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:02,800
so, make sure that you are
on the fourth one that says,

23
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,670
the Attributes Inspector.

24
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:07,660
And so you can change the
styling of the element

25
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,300
that you have selected.

26
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,690
You can also double click on the element

27
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:14,490
to directly edit the text.

28
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:17,020
So we're going to change that to SwiftUI.

29
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:20,230
And notice that when we
change the text here,

30
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:21,680
or the text here,

31
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,100
or the text here,

32
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,900
it's all synchronizing perfectly,

33
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:30,340
so I can even edit here, so for iOS 14,

34
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,510
and press Enter.

35
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:33,200
Now let's change the font.

36
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,500
And when we click on the menu,

37
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,550
we have access to the dynamic type.

38
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:39,810
If you're not familiar with
the iOS design guidelines,

39
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:43,340
I highly suggest that you
go to the visual design part

40
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,100
in typography.

41
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,680
And here if you scroll down a little bit,

42
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,080
you're going to find all
the dynamic type sizes

43
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:54,370
for title one, two, three,
headline, body, and so on.

44
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:57,570
And what is interesting
is that if you use this,

45
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:59,970
it's going to adapt automatically

46
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:02,690
to different accessibility options.

47
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:05,270
And not only that, it will
adapt to the platform,

48
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:09,070
so, a title on a Mac
will be slightly smaller

49
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:10,970
than a title in iOS.

50
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:13,530
So you should absolutely use dynamic type

51
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:15,360
because it will save you time,

52
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,500
but also, it will make it
adaptive across platforms.

53
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,680
So here, we're just going
to go and set it to body,

54
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,140
but body is also set by default.

55
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:28,360
So, you can also select inherited.

56
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,320
For the font weight,

57
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,070
we're going to set it to bold,

58
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:33,090
then we're going to create a second text.

59
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:36,910
So, you can just select this
and then Command D to duplicate

60
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:40,450
and it will automatically
duplicate the first layer

61
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:42,010
into a second one.

62
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:43,050
But not only that,

63
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:45,890
but it will create a
container called a VStack,

64
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:47,440
which is a vertical stack,

65
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,820
that can align and
stack its inner elements

66
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:53,420
using consistent spacing.

67
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,760
Just like a design tool,

68
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,170
you can select one of
the elements visually,

69
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:00,400
or if the elements are overlapping,

70
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,830
you can go to the code directly,

71
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:05,350
and it's going to select,
let's say the VStack.

72
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:07,520
Now I'm going to double
click the second text

73
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,630
and change it to 20 sections.

74
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:14,520
And here, notice that the
elements are centered by default.

75
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,021
So if you wanna change that,

76
00:03:16,021 --> 00:03:18,380
we're gonna select the
container, which is a VStack,

77
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:21,970
and then we can go to
alignment to the left.

78
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:23,290
In terms of padding,

79
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:25,290
we can select the element.

80
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:28,270
And we're gonna go to the padding area,

81
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:32,840
and you can see here that we
have some values by default.

82
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,603
And you can click on this to remove it.

83
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:39,390
So now it does not have
any padding anymore.

84
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:42,423
We're gonna do the same for
the second text and remove it.

85
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,523
Let's change the font to footnote,

86
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:49,400
and then we're going to remove the bold,

87
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,600
and by clicking on the blue button here.

88
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,520
So you can see here that
between these two elements,

89
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,930
we would like to have some padding

90
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:00,670
but we don't necessarily
want to have manual padding,

91
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:03,380
which is not the most
optimal way to do it.

92
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:06,410
And instead, we should
go to the container,

93
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:07,890
which is the VStack,

94
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:10,810
and set the spacing instead.

95
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:13,590
So we're gonna go to the spacing value

96
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:16,450
and set it to four, and Enter.

97
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:19,840
Different from a padding
which surrounds an element,

98
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,410
the spacing is a gap between
the elements within a stack.

99
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:26,400
Okay, so let's talk about colors.

100
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,900
Just like dynamic type,

101
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,700
you should avoid using custom colors,

102
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,520
unless, you have a custom background

103
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,260
that will exist the same way
between light and dark mode.

104
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:41,490
So because I haven't set
a color for the title,

105
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,830
it will set itself to primary,

106
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:46,890
which is going to be black in light mode,

107
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:49,430
and then white in dark mode.

108
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:52,390
Now you have access to a
bunch of preset colors.

109
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:56,320
So for example, I'm going
to select on the subtitle.

110
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,380
And I can click on color.

111
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:01,340
And here you're going to
find a bunch of preset colors

112
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,920
that adapts automatically.

113
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,110
So for example,

114
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:07,760
red is different between
light and dark mode.

115
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:11,010
But also you have your
custom assets catalog colors

116
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,560
that we have set earlier.

117
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,600
So if you want a custom color,

118
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,600
make sure that it's set
in your assets catalog.

119
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,800
And if you want to use one of
the preset colors by Apple,

120
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,530
you can go to the iOS guidelines,

121
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:25,170
and you scroll down a little bit,

122
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:27,130
you're going to find the different colors

123
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:28,520
for light and dark mode.

124
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,710
So back to our app,

125
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:31,650
we're going to select the container,

126
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:34,740
and then we're going to
add a background color.

127
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,280
But here you can see that

128
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:39,120
there is no background
color in the inspector.

129
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,500
In fact, there are hundreds missing.

130
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,520
And each of these properties
is called a modifier,

131
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,510
and you can add custom ones

132
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:48,650
by going to this field at the bottom.

133
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:51,030
Unfortunately, during
this version of the beta,

134
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:53,710
it's not available from here,

135
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:56,320
but you can definitely
go to the plus sign.

136
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,190
And this is what we call the Insert menu.

137
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:02,870
So you have the controls
which is the Button,

138
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:05,350
Date Picker, Form, etcetera.

139
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:06,830
And then you have the modifiers,

140
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:09,010
which are the properties the styling.

141
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:12,090
So we're gonna search for background.

142
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:14,720
And here, where we find background,

143
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,620
we're going to drag and drop
directly to the inspector

144
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,010
like this.

145
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:22,330
Make sure you're applying
to the right element.

146
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:25,720
In this case, I have the
vertical stack selected.

147
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,060
And notice that as soon as I did that,

148
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:32,270
I have a new property, and
I can change the color.

149
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:35,730
For some reason, after we
added the background color,

150
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:37,650
the modifiers are working now.

151
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:39,450
So we're going to search for corner,

152
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,460
and select on corner radius.

153
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,303
Let's change the number to 20.

154
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,720
And let's add a little bit of padding.

155
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,180
So I'm gonna go to the
padding and click on

156
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,970
the circle on the right side,

157
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:57,950
and this will apply a default
of 16 points on all sides.

158
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,650
Let's add another modifier.

159
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:01,713
This time it's going to be called shadow.

160
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:07,330
Great. Now we want to add an
image at the top of the text.

161
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:10,150
So, we're going to go to Insert again.

162
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:12,590
And we're going to go to images.

163
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:15,120
And this is from my assets catalog,

164
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,840
I'm going to select the first one.

165
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,510
So, illustration one.

166
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:21,400
Drag and drop directly to the preview,

167
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,940
and here I can target
any part that I want.

168
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:29,940
So, middle top, bottom of the
text, or even to the left.

169
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:34,763
So in this case, I'm going to
do it at the top of the title,

170
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:37,730
and it's going to look like this.

171
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:39,330
If you look at the structure of the code,

172
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:40,520
we have the VStack,

173
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,710
and then we have three
elements inside the VStack.

174
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:46,930
Now you can see that the
image is a little bit too big.

175
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:48,700
And that's because SwiftUI

176
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:52,080
always take the original
size of the image.

177
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,870
And so what you need to do to
fix that is to add a modifier.

178
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:59,000
While having the image selected,

179
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'm going to type with
sizeable and select.

180
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:07,670
This will make sure to resize the image

181
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:10,680
and use all available space.

182
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:14,290
And in this case, the image
doesn't have the right ratio.

183
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:15,650
So there's another modifier.

184
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:20,650
So we're gonna type ratio
and select aspect ratio.

185
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,230
And now it tries to fit
within the bounds using fill.

186
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:27,743
And you can switch to fit instead,

187
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:29,760
like this.

188
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,950
So, this technique is great

189
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:35,610
because that means that the
image will always resize,

190
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:39,570
based on the maximum width
or height of the card.

191
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:42,420
So, if I was to click on the VStack,

192
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:46,010
and set the height to let's say, 200,

193
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:48,660
you're gonna see that the inner elements

194
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:51,270
are going to try to resize.

195
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:52,920
And this is really good,

196
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:57,220
when it comes to making your
layout adaptive across devices.

197
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,580
At the end of the day,

198
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,030
you want to create this component

199
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:04,140
to adapt to any number
of columns and rows.

200
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:07,960
Which is why we don't really
want to set a fixed frame.

201
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,830
So we're gonna remove that 200 of height.

202
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:13,710
Another feature that is new in Xcode 12

203
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:16,460
is that you can duplicate the preview.

204
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,070
And for each preview,

205
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:20,420
you can select on the options,

206
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:25,290
to change the device, the
layout, the color scheme,

207
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:28,050
and the accessibility options such as,

208
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:30,600
extra extra large text for example.

209
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,253
In this case, we're
gonna select dark mode.

210
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:40,420
Now you can zoom out and you
can see that my text here

211
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:45,350
is changing colors based
on light and dark mode.

212
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:48,180
So, because I haven't set a color,

213
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,680
it's set to black by default,

214
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,000
and for dark mode, it's set to white.

215
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,310
Now as I mentioned before,

216
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:56,440
you don't really want to set custom colors

217
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,810
unless, you have a custom background,

218
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:02,680
that is always, let's say blue
for both light and dark mode,

219
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,750
in which case,

220
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:06,950
you can always make, let's
say the text to be white.

221
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:11,363
I'm gonna select the first
text and set it to white.

222
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,533
Let's do the same for
the second text as well.

223
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:20,910
So now both cards are consistent.

224
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,600
One other thing that I want to point out

225
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,010
is that the inspector is available here,

226
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:28,560
but can also be available
directly on a preview.

227
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,550
So you can Command click on the element

228
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:35,650
to go to, Show SwiftUI Inspector,

229
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:39,710
and these options will be
exactly the same as these.

230
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:42,500
There is a shortcut without
having to do two clicks.

231
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:46,570
So you can do Control option and select.

232
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:49,600
It's going to go directly
to the inspector.

233
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,290
The same for the preview.

234
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:54,940
So, if I select the preview itself,

235
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,900
it's going to show me
the options right here

236
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,830
instead of here.

237
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:02,200
Now, let me change the preview.

238
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:06,340
I'm going to go to layout
and change to fixed.

239
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,830
This is where I'm going to set,

240
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:12,830
let's say 200 of width by 200 of height.

241
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:16,130
So now I can see what
it's going to look like,

242
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:19,130
if my layout or device is this size.

243
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:22,090
I'm also noticing that
there's a bit of a gap here,

244
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:25,220
and maybe I want to set my
card to take the whole screen

245
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,810
vertically as well.

246
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:29,720
And for that, I'm going
to need to set a spacer.

247
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,100
A spacer is not a modifier.

248
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,770
It's an element that push the container

249
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:36,820
to take the full space.

250
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:39,410
So let me click on the plus sign.

251
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:43,313
I'm going to go to controls
and search for spacer.

252
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:47,260
Here, I'm going to drag and drop.

253
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,510
And again, anywhere I want.

254
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:53,620
In this case, let's say
at the top of the image.

255
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,940
And when I do that,

256
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:58,640
you can see that it's
pushing the entire cart

257
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:03,640
to take the available space at
the position that I put here.

258
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,760
Now you're seeing a
little bit of a gap here,

259
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,460
that's the safe area,

260
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,660
and that has nothing to do with your cart.

261
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,280
This is device dependent,

262
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,010
and we can take care of that later.

263
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:14,500
So taking care of this gap,

264
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,570
what we can do is the same thing.

265
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:20,270
So, we're going to click on a
plus sign, search for spacer,

266
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:25,270
and drag and drop right to the
left of the image like this.

267
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:28,660
Now, because we're pushing on one side,

268
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,250
the image is no longer centered

269
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,180
so we need another spacer
to the right side as well.

270
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,950
And there's a shortcut for the Insert,

271
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:37,790
which is Shift Command and L,

272
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,680
and again, search for spacer,

273
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,450
drag and drop to the
right side of the image.

274
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:43,380
Looking at the image,

275
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:47,730
you can see that it's now
inside a horizontal stack,

276
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:51,400
and it has a space to the
left and to the right.

277
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,720
And it's pushing the cart

278
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,630
to take the full width of the screen.

279
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:57,810
So now I just created a cart

280
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:00,710
that is fully adaptive
for all screens sizes,

281
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:02,710
and I can even make it repeat,

282
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:06,430
let's say in a grid layout
or in a list layout.

283
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:07,400
Before we finish,

284
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:11,170
I just want to mention that
even though this is great

285
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:12,800
to use the inspector,

286
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,060
and to use the preview,
using drag and drop,

287
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:19,080
please keep in mind that
you will miss some options

288
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:23,360
and you won't have as much
control as much as in code.

289
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,900
And also, you shouldn't
leave these values blue.

290
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,800
So we're just gonna double click them.

291
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:33,860
Now for the background, it becomes empty.

292
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,990
And so inside the parentheses,

293
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:39,833
we're gonna type color dot blue.

294
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:45,130
Let's do the same for
the two numbers here.

295
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:49,060
All right, so today I wanted
to show you all the new options

296
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:51,860
for the visual editing tools of SwiftUI.

297
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:54,140
And this is especially
great for beginners,

298
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:56,500
for designers, for prototyping.

299
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,730
So if you have co-workers who
have never touched SwiftUI

300
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:04,130
this is a great introduction
to Xcode and to SwiftUI.

301
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:05,040
In the next session,

302
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,620
we're going to learn about SF symbols

303
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,690
and how to use list styles.

304
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:11,490
So I'll see you in the next session.
