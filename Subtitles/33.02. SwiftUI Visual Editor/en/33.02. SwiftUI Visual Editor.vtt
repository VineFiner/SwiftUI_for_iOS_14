00:00:05.725 --> 00:00:10.725
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.530
<v Meng>Hi, Welcome to a second session,</v>

3
00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:16.180
of my SwiftUI course.

4
00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:17.013
In this session,

5
00:00:17.013 --> 00:00:19.940
we're going to learn how to create a very basic cart design

6
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.740
using SwiftUI new visual editing tools.

7
00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.540
Now the first thing we're going to do

8
00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.150
is to resume our preview.

9
00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.050
This might take a couple minutes

10
00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.600
if you're doing it for the first time.

11
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.840
And so when it's loaded,

12
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.290
this is a visual representation of your code here.

13
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.700
And the device itself

14
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.790
can be changed by going to the device list here.

15
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.980
We can change that for iOS 11 Pro.

16
00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.710
And so today, we're not even going to touch the code at all.

17
00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.670
We're just gonna click on the elements

18
00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.520
and then go to the inspector,

19
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.820
and this is where you can customize

20
00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.310
your elements appearance.

21
00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.350
Now the inspector has a bunch of tabs,

22
00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.800
so, make sure that you are on the fourth one that says,

23
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.670
the Attributes Inspector.

24
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.660
And so you can change the styling of the element

25
00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.300
that you have selected.

26
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.690
You can also double click on the element

27
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.490
to directly edit the text.

28
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.020
So we're going to change that to SwiftUI.

29
00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.230
And notice that when we change the text here,

30
00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:21.680
or the text here,

31
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.100
or the text here,

32
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.900
it's all synchronizing perfectly,

33
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.340 line:15% 
so I can even edit here, so for iOS 14,

34
00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.510
and press Enter.

35
00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.200
Now let's change the font.

36
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.500
And when we click on the menu,

37
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.550
we have access to the dynamic type.

38
00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.810
If you're not familiar with the iOS design guidelines,

39
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.340
I highly suggest that you go to the visual design part

40
00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.100
in typography.

41
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.680
And here if you scroll down a little bit,

42
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.080
you're going to find all the dynamic type sizes

43
00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.370
for title one, two, three, headline, body, and so on.

44
00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.570
And what is interesting is that if you use this,

45
00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.970
it's going to adapt automatically

46
00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.690
to different accessibility options.

47
00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.270
And not only that, it will adapt to the platform,

48
00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.070
so, a title on a Mac will be slightly smaller

49
00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:10.970
than a title in iOS.

50
00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.530
So you should absolutely use dynamic type

51
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.360
because it will save you time,

52
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.500
but also, it will make it adaptive across platforms.

53
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.680
So here, we're just going to go and set it to body,

54
00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.140
but body is also set by default.

55
00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.360
So, you can also select inherited.

56
00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.320
For the font weight,

57
00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.070
we're going to set it to bold,

58
00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.090
then we're going to create a second text.

59
00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.910 line:15% 
So, you can just select this and then Command D to duplicate

60
00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.450
and it will automatically duplicate the first layer

61
00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.010
into a second one.

62
00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.050
But not only that,

63
00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.890
but it will create a container called a VStack,

64
00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.440
which is a vertical stack,

65
00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.820
that can align and stack its inner elements

66
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.420
using consistent spacing.

67
00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:54.760
Just like a design tool,

68
00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.170
you can select one of the elements visually,

69
00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.400
or if the elements are overlapping,

70
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.830
you can go to the code directly,

71
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.350
and it's going to select, let's say the VStack.

72
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.520
Now I'm going to double click the second text

73
00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.630
and change it to 20 sections.

74
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.520
And here, notice that the elements are centered by default.

75
00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.021
So if you wanna change that,

76
00:03:16.021 --> 00:03:18.380
we're gonna select the container, which is a VStack,

77
00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.970
and then we can go to alignment to the left.

78
00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.290
In terms of padding,

79
00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.290
we can select the element.

80
00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.270
And we're gonna go to the padding area,

81
00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:32.840
and you can see here that we have some values by default.

82
00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.603
And you can click on this to remove it.

83
00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.390
So now it does not have any padding anymore.

84
00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.423
We're gonna do the same for the second text and remove it.

85
00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.523
Let's change the font to footnote,

86
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.400
and then we're going to remove the bold,

87
00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.600
and by clicking on the blue button here.

88
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.520
So you can see here that between these two elements,

89
00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.930
we would like to have some padding

90
00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.670
but we don't necessarily want to have manual padding,

91
00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.380
which is not the most optimal way to do it.

92
00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.410
And instead, we should go to the container,

93
00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:07.890
which is the VStack,

94
00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.810
and set the spacing instead.

95
00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.590
So we're gonna go to the spacing value

96
00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.450 line:15% 
and set it to four, and Enter.

97
00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:19.840
Different from a padding which surrounds an element,

98
00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.410
the spacing is a gap between the elements within a stack.

99
00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.400
Okay, so let's talk about colors.

100
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.900
Just like dynamic type,

101
00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.700
you should avoid using custom colors,

102
00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.520
unless, you have a custom background

103
00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.260
that will exist the same way between light and dark mode.

104
00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.490
So because I haven't set a color for the title,

105
00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.830
it will set itself to primary,

106
00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.890
which is going to be black in light mode,

107
00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:49.430
and then white in dark mode.

108
00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.390
Now you have access to a bunch of preset colors.

109
00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:56.320
So for example, I'm going to select on the subtitle.

110
00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.380
And I can click on color.

111
00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.340
And here you're going to find a bunch of preset colors

112
00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:02.920
that adapts automatically.

113
00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.110
So for example,

114
00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.760
red is different between light and dark mode.

115
00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.010
But also you have your custom assets catalog colors

116
00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:12.560
that we have set earlier.

117
00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.600
So if you want a custom color,

118
00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.600
make sure that it's set in your assets catalog.

119
00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.800
And if you want to use one of the preset colors by Apple,

120
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.530
you can go to the iOS guidelines,

121
00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:25.170
and you scroll down a little bit,

122
00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:27.130
you're going to find the different colors

123
00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:28.520
for light and dark mode.

124
00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:29.710
So back to our app,

125
00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:31.650
we're going to select the container,

126
00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:34.740
and then we're going to add a background color.

127
00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.280
But here you can see that

128
00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.120
there is no background color in the inspector.

129
00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.500
In fact, there are hundreds missing.

130
00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.520
And each of these properties is called a modifier,

131
00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.510
and you can add custom ones

132
00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:48.650
by going to this field at the bottom.

133
00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:51.030
Unfortunately, during this version of the beta,

134
00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:53.710
it's not available from here,

135
00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:56.320
but you can definitely go to the plus sign.

136
00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.190
And this is what we call the Insert menu.

137
00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:02.870
So you have the controls which is the Button,

138
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:05.350
Date Picker, Form, etcetera.

139
00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:06.830
And then you have the modifiers,

140
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:09.010
which are the properties the styling.

141
00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:12.090
So we're gonna search for background.

142
00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:14.720
And here, where we find background,

143
00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.620
we're going to drag and drop directly to the inspector

144
00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.010
like this.

145
00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:22.330
Make sure you're applying to the right element.

146
00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:25.720
In this case, I have the vertical stack selected.

147
00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:28.060
And notice that as soon as I did that,

148
00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:32.270
I have a new property, and I can change the color.

149
00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:35.730
For some reason, after we added the background color,

150
00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:37.650
the modifiers are working now.

151
00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:39.450 line:15% 
So we're going to search for corner,

152
00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.460
and select on corner radius.

153
00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:44.303 line:15% 
Let's change the number to 20.

154
00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:47.720
And let's add a little bit of padding.

155
00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:51.180
So I'm gonna go to the padding and click on

156
00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:52.970
the circle on the right side,

157
00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:57.950
and this will apply a default of 16 points on all sides.

158
00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:59.650
Let's add another modifier.

159
00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:01.713 line:15% 
This time it's going to be called shadow.

160
00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:07.330
Great. Now we want to add an image at the top of the text.

161
00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:10.150
So, we're going to go to Insert again.

162
00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:12.590
And we're going to go to images.

163
00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:15.120
And this is from my assets catalog,

164
00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.840
I'm going to select the first one.

165
00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:18.510
So, illustration one.

166
00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:21.400
Drag and drop directly to the preview,

167
00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:24.940
and here I can target any part that I want.

168
00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:29.940
So, middle top, bottom of the text, or even to the left.

169
00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:34.763
So in this case, I'm going to do it at the top of the title,

170
00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:37.730
and it's going to look like this.

171
00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:39.330
If you look at the structure of the code,

172
00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:40.520
we have the VStack,

173
00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:43.710
and then we have three elements inside the VStack.

174
00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:46.930
Now you can see that the image is a little bit too big.

175
00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:48.700
And that's because SwiftUI

176
00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:52.080
always take the original size of the image.

177
00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:56.870
And so what you need to do to fix that is to add a modifier.

178
00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:59.000
While having the image selected,

179
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000 line:15% 
I'm going to type with sizeable and select.

180
00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:07.670
This will make sure to resize the image

181
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:10.680
and use all available space.

182
00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:14.290
And in this case, the image doesn't have the right ratio.

183
00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:15.650
So there's another modifier.

184
00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:20.650 line:15% 
So we're gonna type ratio and select aspect ratio.

185
00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:25.230
And now it tries to fit within the bounds using fill.

186
00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:27.743
And you can switch to fit instead,

187
00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:29.760
like this.

188
00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:31.950
So, this technique is great

189
00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:35.610
because that means that the image will always resize,

190
00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:39.570
based on the maximum width or height of the card.

191
00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:42.420
So, if I was to click on the VStack,

192
00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:46.010 line:15% 
and set the height to let's say, 200,

193
00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:48.660
you're gonna see that the inner elements

194
00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:51.270
are going to try to resize.

195
00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:52.920
And this is really good,

196
00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:57.220
when it comes to making your layout adaptive across devices.

197
00:08:57.220 --> 00:08:58.580
At the end of the day,

198
00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:01.030
you want to create this component

199
00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:04.140
to adapt to any number of columns and rows.

200
00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:07.960
Which is why we don't really want to set a fixed frame.

201
00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:10.830
So we're gonna remove that 200 of height.

202
00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:13.710
Another feature that is new in Xcode 12

203
00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:16.460
is that you can duplicate the preview.

204
00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:18.070
And for each preview,

205
00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:20.420
you can select on the options,

206
00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:25.290
to change the device, the layout, the color scheme,

207
00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:28.050
and the accessibility options such as,

208
00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:30.600
extra extra large text for example.

209
00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:33.253
In this case, we're gonna select dark mode.

210
00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:40.420
Now you can zoom out and you can see that my text here

211
00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:45.350
is changing colors based on light and dark mode.

212
00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:48.180
So, because I haven't set a color,

213
00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:50.680
it's set to black by default,

214
00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:53.000
and for dark mode, it's set to white.

215
00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.310
Now as I mentioned before,

216
00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:56.440
you don't really want to set custom colors

217
00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:58.810
unless, you have a custom background,

218
00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:02.680
that is always, let's say blue for both light and dark mode,

219
00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:03.750
in which case,

220
00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:06.950
you can always make, let's say the text to be white.

221
00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:11.363
I'm gonna select the first text and set it to white.

222
00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:16.533
Let's do the same for the second text as well.

223
00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:20.910
So now both cards are consistent.

224
00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:22.600
One other thing that I want to point out

225
00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:25.010
is that the inspector is available here,

226
00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:28.560
but can also be available directly on a preview.

227
00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:31.550 line:15% 
So you can Command click on the element

228
00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:35.650
to go to, Show SwiftUI Inspector,

229
00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:39.710
and these options will be exactly the same as these.

230
00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:42.500
There is a shortcut without having to do two clicks.

231
00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:46.570 line:15% 
So you can do Control option and select.

232
00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:49.600
It's going to go directly to the inspector.

233
00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.290
The same for the preview.

234
00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:54.940
So, if I select the preview itself,

235
00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:56.900
it's going to show me the options right here

236
00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:59.830
instead of here.

237
00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:02.200
Now, let me change the preview.

238
00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:06.340
I'm going to go to layout and change to fixed.

239
00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:07.830
This is where I'm going to set,

240
00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:12.830 line:15% 
let's say 200 of width by 200 of height.

241
00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:16.130
So now I can see what it's going to look like,

242
00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:19.130
if my layout or device is this size.

243
00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:22.090
I'm also noticing that there's a bit of a gap here,

244
00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:25.220
and maybe I want to set my card to take the whole screen

245
00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:26.810
vertically as well.

246
00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:29.720
And for that, I'm going to need to set a spacer.

247
00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:32.100
A spacer is not a modifier.

248
00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:34.770
It's an element that push the container

249
00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:36.820
to take the full space.

250
00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:39.410
So let me click on the plus sign.

251
00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:43.313 line:15% 
I'm going to go to controls and search for spacer.

252
00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:47.260
Here, I'm going to drag and drop.

253
00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.510
And again, anywhere I want.

254
00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:53.620
In this case, let's say at the top of the image.

255
00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:54.940
And when I do that,

256
00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:58.640
you can see that it's pushing the entire cart

257
00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:03.640
to take the available space at the position that I put here.

258
00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:05.760
Now you're seeing a little bit of a gap here,

259
00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:07.460
that's the safe area,

260
00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:09.660
and that has nothing to do with your cart.

261
00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:11.280
This is device dependent,

262
00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:13.010
and we can take care of that later.

263
00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:14.500
So taking care of this gap,

264
00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:16.570
what we can do is the same thing.

265
00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:20.270 line:15% 
So, we're going to click on a plus sign, search for spacer,

266
00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:25.270
and drag and drop right to the left of the image like this.

267
00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:28.660
Now, because we're pushing on one side,

268
00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:30.250
the image is no longer centered

269
00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:33.180
so we need another spacer to the right side as well.

270
00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:34.950
And there's a shortcut for the Insert,

271
00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:37.790 line:15% 
which is Shift Command and L,

272
00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:39.680 line:15% 
and again, search for spacer,

273
00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:42.450
drag and drop to the right side of the image.

274
00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:43.380
Looking at the image,

275
00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:47.730
you can see that it's now inside a horizontal stack,

276
00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:51.400
and it has a space to the left and to the right.

277
00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:53.720
And it's pushing the cart

278
00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:55.630
to take the full width of the screen.

279
00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:57.810
So now I just created a cart

280
00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:00.710
that is fully adaptive for all screens sizes,

281
00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:02.710
and I can even make it repeat,

282
00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:06.430
let's say in a grid layout or in a list layout.

283
00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:07.400
Before we finish,

284
00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:11.170
I just want to mention that even though this is great

285
00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:12.800
to use the inspector,

286
00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:16.060
and to use the preview, using drag and drop,

287
00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:19.080
please keep in mind that you will miss some options

288
00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:23.360
and you won't have as much control as much as in code.

289
00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:25.900
And also, you shouldn't leave these values blue.

290
00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:27.800
So we're just gonna double click them.

291
00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:33.860
Now for the background, it becomes empty.

292
00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:35.990
And so inside the parentheses,

293
00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:39.833 line:15% 
we're gonna type color dot blue.

294
00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:45.130
Let's do the same for the two numbers here.

295
00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:49.060
All right, so today I wanted to show you all the new options

296
00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:51.860
for the visual editing tools of SwiftUI.

297
00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:54.140
And this is especially great for beginners,

298
00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:56.500
for designers, for prototyping.

299
00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:59.730
So if you have co-workers who have never touched SwiftUI

300
00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:04.130
this is a great introduction to Xcode and to SwiftUI.

301
00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:05.040
In the next session,

302
00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:07.620
we're going to learn about SF symbols

303
00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:09.690
and how to use list styles.

304
00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:11.490
So I'll see you in the next session.
