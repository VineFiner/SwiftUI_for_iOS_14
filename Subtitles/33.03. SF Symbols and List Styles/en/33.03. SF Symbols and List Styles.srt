00:00:05,855 --> 00:00:10,772
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:13,503
- [Meng] Hey there,

3
00:00:13,503 --> 00:00:16,410
welcome to our third session
of the SwiftUI course.

4
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,070
Today we're gonna to learn
how to use SF symbols

5
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:20,950
to create these lists layouts

6
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:23,720
that you can see everywhere in iOS.

7
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,310
In the content of each session,

8
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:28,860
I'm trying to link to resources
that are being discussed,

9
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:31,640
such as the SF Symbols app,

10
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,580
which you should download
for SF Symbols 2.

11
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:35,413
And also,

12
00:00:35,413 --> 00:00:37,490
there are a bunch of Dub Dub DC videos

13
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:41,110
that you can find the
developer app by Apple.

14
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:45,300
And here, you can search
for SF symbols for example,

15
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,630
and there, you have SF
symbol two, as a video.

16
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:53,130
Again, these resources will be
linked from the text content.

17
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:55,530
Now focusing on the new SF symbols

18
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,900
now we have access to multicolor symbols,

19
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:02,810
but also I'm going to show you
how to use them in SwiftUI,

20
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:04,950
and how to create a list styles.

21
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:06,310
So back in Xcode,

22
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:08,130
we're going to create a new file,

23
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:10,750
and we're going to do Command N.

24
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:13,770
This is going to create
a new SwiftUI view.

25
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:16,313
So we're gonna select this one next.

26
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,203
We're gonna name that CourseRow.

27
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:25,280
You can use the naming convention row

28
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,880
for any repeatable element in the list.

29
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,220
First things first, we're
gonna resume the preview,

30
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,200
and then we're going to replace text

31
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,200
by image, parentheses, system name.

32
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,550
So at this point, we're
just gonna go fully code,

33
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:44,730
because it's easier to debug,

34
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:46,610
it's easier to control,

35
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:49,770
and as you get used to
it, it's just faster.

36
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:50,860
Now while you do that,

37
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:54,090
make sure that you're always
using the auto-completion,

38
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:57,190
because names and values
can be rather long,

39
00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:00,030
but also programming is not forgiving,

40
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:03,560
in terms of caps, lowercase and symbols.

41
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,940
So back to our code,

42
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:08,090
here it is expecting a name.

43
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:09,200
And in this case,

44
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,740
we can use the SF symbol name.

45
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,250
If you go to SF symbols,

46
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,620
we're going to go to Multicolor.

47
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:18,470
And let's select this
one called paperplane.

48
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:20,540
There's a shortcut to copy the code.

49
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:23,680
So in Edit, it's Copy Name,

50
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,100
and the shortcut is Shift Command and C.

51
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,910
So Shift Command C.

52
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:30,610
Back to Xcode,

53
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:34,660
we're going to paste that
inside double quotes,

54
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:35,750
like this.

55
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,960
Now you're gonna to see the icon.

56
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,940
It's barely visible because
it's very small by default.

57
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,620
But if you zoom in, you
can see it more clearly.

58
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:47,110
You can also make it bigger,
so it has three sizes.

59
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:48,980
And we can use a modifier.

60
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,750
So, right after image,

61
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:55,180
we're going to type dot imageScale.

62
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:57,350
And then you can have medium

63
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:00,050
and if you press dot you're gonna find

64
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:03,210
all the options available
to us in this context.

65
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:06,030
So, you can also have large.

66
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:09,040
So if you want to use
the multicolor option,

67
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,180
we have to add a modifier
before the imageScale,

68
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,563
so, dot renderingMode,

69
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:18,563
then, dot original.

70
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,600
So with this technique,

71
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,440
you have access to all 2400 icons

72
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,780
without importing any asset related to it.

73
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,000
And on top of that,

74
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,510
it works for the Mac as well,

75
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:31,820
and you can change the font size

76
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:35,490
to perfectly match the text
and even match the font weight,

77
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:39,210
which is equivalent to the
stroke width of the icon.

78
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:40,550
Now, I do want to point out

79
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:43,360
that if you're using the font properties,

80
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,310
you're not going to be
able to use the multicolor,

81
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,990
so the renderingMode and the imageScale

82
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:50,310
will not be very useful,

83
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:54,370
because the font size
changes the size of the icon.

84
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:57,740
But first of all, let me
add a text next to the icon.

85
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,640
So let me insert,

86
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,540
it's going To take care
of the stack for me.

87
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:05,280
And I'm going to insert a text.

88
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,660
Selecting the text,

89
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:10,130
drag and drop to the right of the icon.

90
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:12,780
So I can change the font size individually

91
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,710
for the text and image,

92
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:18,750
but I can also put the
modifier in the container

93
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,320
and it's going to apply
to both at the same time.

94
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,153
Let me do that.

95
00:04:22,153 --> 00:04:24,290
So right after HStack,

96
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:28,540
I'm going to type dot font, Enter,

97
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,520
and then set it to title.

98
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,220
So what you're noticing here,

99
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:36,450
is that the font is being applied
to both of these elements.

100
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:40,410
But also, the renderingMode
no longer works.

101
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:44,850
And if I change the font
size to large title,

102
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:48,510
both the icon and the text will resize.

103
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:50,730
Now if you want to change the font weight,

104
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:53,580
as well as the stroke width of the icon,

105
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:57,360
we'll have to replace
large title by system.

106
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,520
And here we have a bunch of options,

107
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,090
such as size, weight and design.

108
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:04,080
So we're going to select this one.

109
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,210
And now we can set a
custom font size such as,

110
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:10,610
let's say 34, which is the
size of the large title.

111
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:14,460
And the font weight
can be, let's say bold.

112
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,880
And for the font, if you type dot,

113
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,210
you're going to find that you have

114
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:21,020
the choice between
default which is SF Pro,

115
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,460
mono spaces, SF mono,

116
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:27,380
SF routed for rounded
and series is New York.

117
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:29,073
Let's use rounded.

118
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:34,220
Now you're gonna see that
the text is more rounded,

119
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:37,130
but the icon is not changed by the font.

120
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:41,920
It's only changed by the
weight, as well as the size.

121
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,453
So if I set it to, let's say light,

122
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,750
you're gonna see that the icon is lighter.

123
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,930
And likewise for the text.

124
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:52,670
Now, remember about the imageScale,

125
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:55,540
I can use medium now or small

126
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:58,870
depending on the ratio that
I want versus the text.

127
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:01,680
Okay, so this layout here
is fairly common for,

128
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,990
let's say a menu.

129
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:05,350
But what if I want a second line of text.

130
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:07,623
So let's just add a new text,

131
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:13,750
and drag that right
underneath the first text.

132
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:17,090
So it's going to create a
VStack containing both text.

133
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:22,040
So now I'm just going to
change back my dot system

134
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,420
to dot subheadline.

135
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:28,380
Now make sure that there's
only one set of parentheses.

136
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:32,840
And instead of applying
both the icon and the text,

137
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,160
I'm just going to cut it so Command X,

138
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,920
and just put it on the first title.

139
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:43,130
Then I'm going to paste the same modifier

140
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:45,080
on the second title.

141
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,120
For the second title,

142
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:49,270
I'm gonna set it to dot footnote.

143
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,770
Let's change the text.

144
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:53,350
So the first one SwiftUI,

145
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:55,890
the second one, we're
going to change it to,

146
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:57,183
let's say Description.

147
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:01,400
I'm going to add a bold to the first text,

148
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,710
so dot bold parentheses.

149
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:06,810
Next, I'll make sure
that within my VStack,

150
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:09,650
I'm going to align the text to the left.

151
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:13,870
So, in the inspector, click
on alignment to the left.

152
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:16,720
Speaking of inspector versus code,

153
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,870
we're going to select the second text.

154
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,640
And here in color,

155
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,210
you're gonna see that I don't have access

156
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:23,940
to some of the system color.

157
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,020
And one of them is called secondary,

158
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:29,790
which is really useful because
it adapts across devices.

159
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:32,490
Let's go to after dot font,

160
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:35,960
we're going to type dot foregroundColor,

161
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,870
and instead of blue, we're
going to set dot secondary.

162
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,870
This color should not be confused

163
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:44,210
with the ones in the assets catalog.

164
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:48,230
And this is really useful
because it adapts to dark mode.

165
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:50,523
All right, so let me select the VStack.

166
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:54,370
Let's set a spacing of four.

167
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:56,787
And then for the HStack,

168
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:01,370
I'm going to set the
alignment to top. Great.

169
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:05,470
Now I'm going to make my
frame of my icon bigger.

170
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:07,940
So, selecting image,

171
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:12,903
I'm going to go to frame
and set it to 48 by 48.

172
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:17,193
Then I'm going to add a
modifier called background,

173
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,580
then add another one called clip shape,

174
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:24,620
which allows me to mask
around any shape that I want.

175
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:27,900
In this case, by default,
it's set to a circle.

176
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,680
Since both my background
and my image is blue,

177
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,530
I should probably add another
one called foregroundColor

178
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:36,720
to change the color of the icon,

179
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,663
I'm going to set it to white.

180
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:40,500
This is not applying

181
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,600
because the renderingMode
is set to original,

182
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,940
I might want to use template instead.

183
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:49,620
This allows me to color
the icon as I wish.

184
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,600
And so in this case, it's set to white.

185
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,810
Okay, so we can add a spacer to the right

186
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:57,000
in order to push everything
to take the full width.

187
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Let's go to right after VStack
and type Spacer parentheses.

188
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:06,220
Awesome. Now that I have my
row, I can create a new screen.

189
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,260
So let's do that.

190
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:10,800
Command N, select SwiftUI View.

191
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,433
Name it CoursesView.

192
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:16,750
Let's resume this.

193
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:21,750
And then I can replace my text
with CourseRow parentheses.

194
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,260
And now, you can see that I'm referencing

195
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:29,870
the UI element that I
just created earlier.

196
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,630
And to create my list layout,

197
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:34,820
I can just Command click on CourseRow

198
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:39,820
to get to a contextual menu,
and I can select embed in list.

199
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,180
Boom! Now I have my list UI,

200
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:45,600
and I can repeat as many times as I want,

201
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,850
such as 20,

202
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:49,920
and it's going to be scrollable.

203
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,720
If you want to be able to
interact with the preview,

204
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,373
you need to click on play.

205
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:59,993
And this is where you can
scroll the content like this.

206
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,980
Now talking about list styles,

207
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:07,400
we're gonna go to list
and add a modifier called

208
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,123
dot List Style.

209
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,310
And here you don't really know

210
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:14,120
what list styles are available to you,

211
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,690
not even the inspector is helpful.

212
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:18,040
So one thing you can do,

213
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,980
which is super useful,

214
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,870
is to Option Click on any modifier

215
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:24,550
to get to the documentation.

216
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:26,710
And you can click on ListStyle.

217
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:30,280
This will open the built-in documentation,

218
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,530
and then you can scroll,

219
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:34,660
and here you have a bunch
of types that you can use.

220
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,973
For example, we can use
InsetGroupedListStyle,

221
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:43,890
and then paste that right
here, at parentheses.

222
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:45,240
So just like that,

223
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,730
I'm able to have a beautiful new UI

224
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:52,700
based on my custom design,
which is the CourseRow,

225
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:57,210
and the icon that can be
changed to any of the 2400s.

226
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:58,800
That's really powerful.

227
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,420
So I hope you enjoyed this session.

228
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,253
In the next one,

229
00:11:01,253 --> 00:11:04,000
we're gonna to explore
how to create a sidebar

230
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,240
and how to implement the new label.

231
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,073
So I'll see you in the next session.
