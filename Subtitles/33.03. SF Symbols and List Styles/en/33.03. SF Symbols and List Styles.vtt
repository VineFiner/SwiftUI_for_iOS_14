00:00:05.855 --> 00:00:10.772
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:13.503
<v Meng>Hey there,</v>

3
00:00:13.503 --> 00:00:16.410
welcome to our third session of the SwiftUI course.

4
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.070
Today we're gonna to learn how to use SF symbols

5
00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:20.950
to create these lists layouts

6
00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.720
that you can see everywhere in iOS.

7
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.310
In the content of each session,

8
00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.860
I'm trying to link to resources that are being discussed,

9
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.640
such as the SF Symbols app,

10
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.580
which you should download for SF Symbols 2.

11
00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:35.413
And also,

12
00:00:35.413 --> 00:00:37.490
there are a bunch of Dub Dub DC videos

13
00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.110
that you can find the developer app by Apple.

14
00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.300
And here, you can search for SF symbols for example,

15
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.630
and there, you have SF symbol two, as a video.

16
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.130
Again, these resources will be linked from the text content.

17
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.530
Now focusing on the new SF symbols

18
00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.900
now we have access to multicolor symbols,

19
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.810
but also I'm going to show you how to use them in SwiftUI,

20
00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:04.950
and how to create a list styles.

21
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:06.310
So back in Xcode,

22
00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.130
we're going to create a new file,

23
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.750
and we're going to do Command N.

24
00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.770
This is going to create a new SwiftUI view.

25
00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.313
So we're gonna select this one next.

26
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.203
We're gonna name that CourseRow.

27
00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.280
You can use the naming convention row

28
00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.880
for any repeatable element in the list.

29
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.220
First things first, we're gonna resume the preview,

30
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.200
and then we're going to replace text

31
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.200
by image, parentheses, system name.

32
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.550
So at this point, we're just gonna go fully code,

33
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.730
because it's easier to debug,

34
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.610
it's easier to control,

35
00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.770
and as you get used to it, it's just faster.

36
00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:50.860
Now while you do that,

37
00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.090
make sure that you're always using the auto-completion,

38
00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.190
because names and values can be rather long,

39
00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.030
but also programming is not forgiving,

40
00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.560
in terms of caps, lowercase and symbols.

41
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.940
So back to our code,

42
00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.090
here it is expecting a name.

43
00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:09.200
And in this case,

44
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.740
we can use the SF symbol name.

45
00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.250
If you go to SF symbols,

46
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.620
we're going to go to Multicolor.

47
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.470
And let's select this one called paperplane.

48
00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.540
There's a shortcut to copy the code.

49
00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.680
So in Edit, it's Copy Name,

50
00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.100
and the shortcut is Shift Command and C.

51
00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.910
So Shift Command C.

52
00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.610
Back to Xcode,

53
00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.660
we're going to paste that inside double quotes,

54
00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:35.750
like this.

55
00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.960
Now you're gonna to see the icon.

56
00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.940
It's barely visible because it's very small by default.

57
00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.620
But if you zoom in, you can see it more clearly.

58
00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.110
You can also make it bigger, so it has three sizes.

59
00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.980
And we can use a modifier.

60
00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.750
So, right after image,

61
00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.180
we're going to type dot imageScale.

62
00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.350
And then you can have medium

63
00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.050
and if you press dot you're gonna find

64
00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.210
all the options available to us in this context.

65
00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:06.030
So, you can also have large.

66
00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.040
So if you want to use the multicolor option,

67
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.180
we have to add a modifier before the imageScale,

68
00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.563
so, dot renderingMode,

69
00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.563
then, dot original.

70
00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:20.600
So with this technique,

71
00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.440
you have access to all 2400 icons

72
00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.780
without importing any asset related to it.

73
00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.000
And on top of that,

74
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.510
it works for the Mac as well,

75
00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.820
and you can change the font size

76
00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:35.490
to perfectly match the text and even match the font weight,

77
00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:39.210
which is equivalent to the stroke width of the icon.

78
00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:40.550
Now, I do want to point out

79
00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.360
that if you're using the font properties,

80
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.310
you're not going to be able to use the multicolor,

81
00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.990
so the renderingMode and the imageScale

82
00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:50.310
will not be very useful,

83
00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.370
because the font size changes the size of the icon.

84
00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.740
But first of all, let me add a text next to the icon.

85
00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:59.640
So let me insert,

86
00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.540
it's going To take care of the stack for me.

87
00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.280
And I'm going to insert a text.

88
00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.660
Selecting the text,

89
00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.130
drag and drop to the right of the icon.

90
00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.780
So I can change the font size individually

91
00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.710
for the text and image,

92
00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:18.750
but I can also put the modifier in the container

93
00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.320
and it's going to apply to both at the same time.

94
00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.153
Let me do that.

95
00:04:22.153 --> 00:04:24.290
So right after HStack,

96
00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.540
I'm going to type dot font, Enter,

97
00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.520
and then set it to title.

98
00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.220
So what you're noticing here,

99
00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.450
is that the font is being applied to both of these elements.

100
00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:40.410
But also, the renderingMode no longer works.

101
00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.850
And if I change the font size to large title,

102
00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:48.510
both the icon and the text will resize.

103
00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.730
Now if you want to change the font weight,

104
00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:53.580
as well as the stroke width of the icon,

105
00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.360
we'll have to replace large title by system.

106
00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.520
And here we have a bunch of options,

107
00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.090
such as size, weight and design.

108
00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.080
So we're going to select this one.

109
00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.210
And now we can set a custom font size such as,

110
00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.610
let's say 34, which is the size of the large title.

111
00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.460
And the font weight can be, let's say bold.

112
00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.880
And for the font, if you type dot,

113
00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.210
you're going to find that you have

114
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.020
the choice between default which is SF Pro,

115
00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.460
mono spaces, SF mono,

116
00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.380
SF routed for rounded and series is New York.

117
00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.073
Let's use rounded.

118
00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:34.220
Now you're gonna see that the text is more rounded,

119
00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.130
but the icon is not changed by the font.

120
00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:41.920
It's only changed by the weight, as well as the size.

121
00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.453
So if I set it to, let's say light,

122
00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.750
you're gonna see that the icon is lighter.

123
00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:49.930
And likewise for the text.

124
00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:52.670
Now, remember about the imageScale,

125
00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:55.540
I can use medium now or small

126
00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:58.870
depending on the ratio that I want versus the text.

127
00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:01.680
Okay, so this layout here is fairly common for,

128
00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:02.990
let's say a menu.

129
00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.350
But what if I want a second line of text.

130
00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:07.623
So let's just add a new text,

131
00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:13.750
and drag that right underneath the first text.

132
00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:17.090
So it's going to create a VStack containing both text.

133
00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:22.040
So now I'm just going to change back my dot system

134
00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:24.420
to dot subheadline.

135
00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:28.380
Now make sure that there's only one set of parentheses.

136
00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:32.840
And instead of applying both the icon and the text,

137
00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:36.160
I'm just going to cut it so Command X,

138
00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.920
and just put it on the first title.

139
00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.130
Then I'm going to paste the same modifier

140
00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:45.080
on the second title.

141
00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.120
For the second title,

142
00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:49.270
I'm gonna set it to dot footnote.

143
00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:50.770
Let's change the text.

144
00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:53.350
So the first one SwiftUI,

145
00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:55.890
the second one, we're going to change it to,

146
00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:57.183
let's say Description.

147
00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:01.400
I'm going to add a bold to the first text,

148
00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:03.710
so dot bold parentheses.

149
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:06.810
Next, I'll make sure that within my VStack,

150
00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:09.650
I'm going to align the text to the left.

151
00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:13.870
So, in the inspector, click on alignment to the left.

152
00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:16.720
Speaking of inspector versus code,

153
00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.870
we're going to select the second text.

154
00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:20.640
And here in color,

155
00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.210
you're gonna see that I don't have access

156
00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:23.940
to some of the system color.

157
00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:26.020
And one of them is called secondary,

158
00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:29.790
which is really useful because it adapts across devices.

159
00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:32.490
Let's go to after dot font,

160
00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:35.960
we're going to type dot foregroundColor,

161
00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:39.870
and instead of blue, we're going to set dot secondary.

162
00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:41.870
This color should not be confused

163
00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:44.210
with the ones in the assets catalog.

164
00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:48.230
And this is really useful because it adapts to dark mode.

165
00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:50.523
All right, so let me select the VStack.

166
00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:54.370
Let's set a spacing of four.

167
00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:56.787
And then for the HStack,

168
00:07:57.670 --> 00:08:01.370
I'm going to set the alignment to top. Great.

169
00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:05.470
Now I'm going to make my frame of my icon bigger.

170
00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:07.940
So, selecting image,

171
00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:12.903
I'm going to go to frame and set it to 48 by 48.

172
00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:17.193
Then I'm going to add a modifier called background,

173
00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:20.580
then add another one called clip shape,

174
00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:24.620
which allows me to mask around any shape that I want.

175
00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:27.900
In this case, by default, it's set to a circle.

176
00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:30.680
Since both my background and my image is blue,

177
00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:33.530
I should probably add another one called foregroundColor

178
00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:36.720
to change the color of the icon,

179
00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:38.663
I'm going to set it to white.

180
00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:40.500
This is not applying

181
00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:43.600
because the renderingMode is set to original,

182
00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:45.940
I might want to use template instead.

183
00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:49.620
This allows me to color the icon as I wish.

184
00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:51.600
And so in this case, it's set to white.

185
00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:53.810
Okay, so we can add a spacer to the right

186
00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:57.000
in order to push everything to take the full width.

187
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Let's go to right after VStack and type Spacer parentheses.

188
00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:06.220
Awesome. Now that I have my row, I can create a new screen.

189
00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:07.260
So let's do that.

190
00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:10.800
Command N, select SwiftUI View.

191
00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.433
Name it CoursesView.

192
00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:16.750
Let's resume this.

193
00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:21.750
And then I can replace my text with CourseRow parentheses.

194
00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:26.260
And now, you can see that I'm referencing

195
00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.870
the UI element that I just created earlier.

196
00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:31.630
And to create my list layout,

197
00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:34.820
I can just Command click on CourseRow

198
00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:39.820
to get to a contextual menu, and I can select embed in list.

199
00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:43.180
Boom! Now I have my list UI,

200
00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:45.600
and I can repeat as many times as I want,

201
00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.850
such as 20,

202
00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:49.920
and it's going to be scrollable.

203
00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:52.720
If you want to be able to interact with the preview,

204
00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.373
you need to click on play.

205
00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:59.993
And this is where you can scroll the content like this.

206
00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:03.980
Now talking about list styles,

207
00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:07.400
we're gonna go to list and add a modifier called

208
00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.123
dot List Style.

209
00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:11.310
And here you don't really know

210
00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:14.120
what list styles are available to you,

211
00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:16.690
not even the inspector is helpful.

212
00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:18.040
So one thing you can do,

213
00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:19.980
which is super useful,

214
00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:22.870
is to Option Click on any modifier

215
00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:24.550
to get to the documentation.

216
00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:26.710
And you can click on ListStyle.

217
00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:30.280
This will open the built-in documentation,

218
00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:31.530
and then you can scroll,

219
00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:34.660
and here you have a bunch of types that you can use.

220
00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:36.973
For example, we can use InsetGroupedListStyle,

221
00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:43.890
and then paste that right here, at parentheses.

222
00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:45.240
So just like that,

223
00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:47.730
I'm able to have a beautiful new UI

224
00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:52.700
based on my custom design, which is the CourseRow,

225
00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:57.210
and the icon that can be changed to any of the 2400s.

226
00:10:57.210 --> 00:10:58.800
That's really powerful.

227
00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:00.420
So I hope you enjoyed this session.

228
00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:01.253
In the next one,

229
00:11:01.253 --> 00:11:04.000
we're gonna to explore how to create a sidebar

230
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.240
and how to implement the new label.

231
00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:08.073
So I'll see you in the next session.
