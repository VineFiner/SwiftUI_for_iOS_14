00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.350
(dramatic music)

2
00:00:06.086 --> 00:00:08.669
(upbeat music)

3
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:13.710
<v Meng>Hi, and welcome back</v>

4
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.240
to our fourth session of my SwiftUI course.

5
00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.480
Today, we're going to learn about the new sidebar.

6
00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.920
So Apple has redesigned most of their iPad apps

7
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.480
to welcome to new sidebar

8
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.020
because it's going to be more consistent with Mac apps.

9
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.390
From a UI perspective, we're now able

10
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.450
to utilize all of the space available to us on the iPad.

11
00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.040
And this navigation here can be super rich,

12
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.190
you can have multiple groups, collapsible menus,

13
00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.910
and even multi-level navigation that goes very deep.

14
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.650
On top of that, it's collapsible

15
00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.990
and it's going to stay on the navbar.

16
00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.470
And if you're in the landscape mode,

17
00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:52.610
you're not gonna see it,

18
00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:54.450
you can just swipe from the left,

19
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.660
or you can click on this button to enable the menu.

20
00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.620
So the top bar on the iPhone will mostly be replaced

21
00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.300
by the sidebar on the iPad, but you can use both on iPhone

22
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.420
so you can decide to have the top bar

23
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.920
and the sidebar as well.

24
00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:12.753
At the end of the day,

25
00:01:12.753 --> 00:01:16.010
this is simply a list with a navigation title

26
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.441
and it's going to be super simple to implement

27
00:01:18.441 --> 00:01:21.500
and it's going to be very adaptive.

28
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.570
Back to Xcode,

29
00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.690
we're going to create a new file for the sidebar,

30
00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.570
so Command + N,

31
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.893
and then press Enter by selecting SwiftUI View.

32
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.513
We're going to name this one Sidebar.

33
00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.450
Let's resume the preview.

34
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.070
And we're going to replace the text by a label instead.

35
00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.200
So first of all, I'm going to delete this

36
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.090
and Command + Shift + L to search for a label.

37
00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.610
And we're going to drag directly to the code

38
00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.900
between the curly braces.

39
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.820
The cool thing about the label is that it's going to replace

40
00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.850
about four lines of code with a single one.

41
00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.210
And here you can customize the text

42
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.980
as well as the SF symbol name.

43
00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:10.980
Let's double click on Label and change that to Courses.

44
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:12.340
For the SF symbol,

45
00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.970
we're gonna change that to book.closed.

46
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.710
Now to create a sidebar menu,

47
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.920
all you need to do is to embed this inside a list.

48
00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.620
First of all, we're going to Command-click on label,

49
00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.410
we're gonna embed this in Vstack,

50
00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.483
then we're going to change Vstack to List.

51
00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.680
Now the magic here is just to set the list style.

52
00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:39.583
So .listStyle.

53
00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.620
And we're going to set it to SidebarListStyle, parentheses.

54
00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.310
So there you go, you have the styling,

55
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.670
but what we're missing is the navigation.

56
00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.530
And in order to have a navigation,

57
00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.460
we're gonna need to put this inside a navigation view.

58
00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:02.460
So again, I'm going to Command-click, embed in VStack

59
00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.963
and change VStack to NavigationView.

60
00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.230
So now if I click on play,

61
00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.960
you're gonna see that I have the navbar if I scroll,

62
00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.290
which means that I can put a title here.

63
00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.170
So right after listStyle,

64
00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.110
we're gonna put .navigationTitle,

65
00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.840
and we're going to type Learn.

66
00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.810
Thanks to the navigation title, when I scroll,

67
00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.700
it's just going to switch to the navbar.

68
00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.230
Now I can definitely add more menu items.

69
00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.980
So I can just copy and paste the label.

70
00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.400
So it's going to add a divider between each.

71
00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.300
Let me just maximize this space here.

72
00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:45.840
And I'm gonna fill some content.

73
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.340
So the next one is Tutorials

74
00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:53.340
and the icon is going to be list.bullet.rectangle.

75
00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.060
Feel free to use your own icons and to create your own menu.

76
00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.930
Let me do the next ones.

77
00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.780
Feel free to copy and paste the code

78
00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.980
that I have in the text content.

79
00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.140
Alright, so just like a tab bar, we're gonna make sure

80
00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.400
that when we click on one of the menu items,

81
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.290
it's going to go to the screen itself.

82
00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.700
So for the first label, I'm going to Command-click it

83
00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.610
and embed in VStack.

84
00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:21.317
This time, I'm going to use a NavigationLink, parentheses,

85
00:04:22.891 --> 00:04:24.891
destination, lower case,

86
00:04:26.239 --> 00:04:29.560
and I'm going to link it to CoursesView, parentheses.

87
00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.350
So as soon as I did that, you see the arrow here,

88
00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.920
and I can click on it, and it goes to my view.

89
00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.630
So this is how the sidebar looks on the iPhone.

90
00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.250
Now for the iPad, we're going to switch the device

91
00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.970
and let's select iPad Pro 11-inch.

92
00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.750
We're going to need to zoom out a little bit.

93
00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.840
And you can see it's basically the same principle

94
00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.400
except that it slides from the left.

95
00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.890
Now you're noticing that by default,

96
00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:00.940
there is no content loaded.

97
00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.750
And honestly, I don't know if this is by design,

98
00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.710
but I found a trick to fix that,

99
00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.830
which is right after the list,

100
00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.900
we're going to insert the courses view.

101
00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.550
So CoursesView, parentheses.

102
00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.690
So now the first time that your app loads,

103
00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.180
it's going to show this screen by default.

104
00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:21.660
Now in the preview,

105
00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.223
it's not gonna show me the landscape mode.

106
00:05:24.223 --> 00:05:26.160
So in order to test that,

107
00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.410
I'm going to have to do Command + R,

108
00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.900
or click on the play button right here.

109
00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.640
And it's going to go to the iOS Simulator,

110
00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.120
and it's going to build the app.

111
00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.300
So when I build my app,

112
00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.670
you're gonna notice that it's loading my cart by default.

113
00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:45.090
And that's because I haven't set up my initial screen.

114
00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:48.120
So the first file that it's going to load

115
00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.920
is called DesignCodeCourseApp.

116
00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:54.540
And you can see here that it's linking to ContentView.

117
00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:59.430
So we can change that to Sidebar, and Command + R again,

118
00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:03.080
and voila, you can see that I have my sidebar on the left.

119
00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.640
You can select it,

120
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.640
and it's also showing this content by default,

121
00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.763
and you can toggle the sidebar.

122
00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:11.560
That's pretty neat.

123
00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.460
So with just a few lines of code,

124
00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.540
I'm able to create a pretty dynamic UI

125
00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:19.160
that can welcome a lot of content.

126
00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.560
There's just one final thing,

127
00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:24.450
is that you can set the navigation title also

128
00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:28.130
for the Courses view and for any view in your menu.

129
00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:30.870
To do that, I'm gonna go to CoursesView,

130
00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:33.250
and right after listStyle,

131
00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:35.870
we're going to set .navigationTitle,

132
00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:38.980
and this time it's going to be Courses.

133
00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:40.833
Now let's run our app again.

134
00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:44.900
And voila.

135
00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:47.600
So you can see I have my menu on the left side,

136
00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.880
and my content with a title

137
00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:53.263
and with a really nice transition when I scroll.

138
00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.970
So that's what I wanted to show you today.

139
00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:59.630
In the next session, we're going to test this UI

140
00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:02.030
with a few tweaks for the Mac app.

141
00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:03.943
So I'll see you in the next session.
