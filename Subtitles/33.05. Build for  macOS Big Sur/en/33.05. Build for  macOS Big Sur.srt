00:00:00,833 --> 00:00:03,500
(intense music)

2
00:00:05,583 --> 00:00:08,166
(upbeat music)

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,440
- [Meng] Hi and welcome to a fifth session

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,130
of my Swift UI course.

5
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:19,370
So everything we have
done so far can be built

6
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:21,060
for the Mac app as well.

7
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:22,210
Now, please keep in mind

8
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:25,200
that in order to test for the Mac app,

9
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,260
you're going to need Big Slur.

10
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,480
If you don't have it,

11
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,020
you're going to need to stick
to what you see on the iPad,

12
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:34,730
as well as the iPhone.

13
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:36,290
So for those who have it,

14
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:40,070
we're going to switch to Mac OS target,

15
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:42,860
and we're going to select my Mac.

16
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:44,620
Now, as soon as you do that,

17
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:46,600
you're going to see
that there are some code

18
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,970
that simply don't work for the Mac.

19
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:52,600
To solve this we're
going to add a condition.

20
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,130
So right before list,

21
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:59,130
we're going to do #ifos parenthesis iOS,

22
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:05,040
then right after .navigation,

23
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,880
we're going to set #else,

24
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,717
and then after that #andif.

25
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,800
In order to use this
condition at the top level,

26
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,450
we're going to need to
add before var body,

27
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:21,593
commercial A view builder.

28
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,890
Now, if you do command B,
it's going to try to build,

29
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:27,910
and the error will disappear.

30
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:28,743
And by the way,

31
00:01:28,743 --> 00:01:30,850
if you do this at this
version of the beta,

32
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:33,850
sometimes the code
highlighting will stop working

33
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:36,140
in some portions, that's normal.

34
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,430
So if you look at the code,

35
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,490
this will run on iOS

36
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:43,250
and whatever is in between
the else and the andif

37
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,810
will run on the Mac.

38
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:45,850
But in this case,

39
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:47,810
we're going to have to repeat the code

40
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:49,670
and we want to avoid doing that.

41
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:51,430
And there's a trick that I learned,

42
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:53,620
which is to use many components.

43
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:56,490
And to do that we're going to declare

44
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:00,520
right after the body curly braces,

45
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:04,560
we're going to add var content

46
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,640
of type some view, curly braces.

47
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,570
And this is where we
can put the entire code.

48
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:15,400
So we're going to cut it, command X,

49
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,660
and we're going to move it to the content

50
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:20,110
inside the curly braces.

51
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:21,030
As a result,

52
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:24,650
we can reference this mini
component called content

53
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:27,210
by just typing content.

54
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:30,570
So I'm going to do that for both places.

55
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:33,810
This is for iOS, and this is for Mac OS.

56
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:36,530
And then whatever code such as a modifier

57
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:38,410
that should only work for iOS.

58
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:41,730
I can just cut it by selecting it

59
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:46,730
and command X and then
paste it just for iOS.

60
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:50,850
So this is great for
breaking down a huge view

61
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:53,700
and not having to create a new some view

62
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,170
where you would have to pass data.

63
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:59,610
And it's especially useful
when you're targeting

64
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:01,830
for specific platforms.

65
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:05,420
So now, are you ready to
run your first Mac OS app?

66
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,133
Well, let's just click on resume.

67
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:08,813
And there you go.

68
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:12,520
So your list UI should
look just like this.

69
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,670
If you want to interact with your Mac app,

70
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:16,830
you're going to have to click play,

71
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:19,760
and then we have to click bring forward.

72
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,660
So this will create two windows.

73
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,920
The first one is the X code preview.

74
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,630
So every time you make a change here,

75
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:31,160
it's going to auto update
the X code preview.

76
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,470
The second one is the actual app.

77
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:35,190
So if you hide X code,

78
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:37,440
you can see that this is your app.

79
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,680
It has your icon,

80
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:42,540
it has the sidebar, which is
the first view being loaded.

81
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,430
And remember just like the iPad,

82
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:48,440
we have the courses and it
goes to the courses view.

83
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:52,100
So developing for the Mac, iOS
has some slight differences.

84
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,280
So for example,

85
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,350
each content space should
always have a frame.

86
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:59,300
Otherwise you can resize it

87
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:02,130
and it's going to hide a bunch of things,

88
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:04,300
or you're going to see a tiny window

89
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,440
with a minimum content,

90
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,790
and it's going to look buggy.

91
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:10,620
So if you don't need to
interact with your Mac app,

92
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,920
it's just best to stop.

93
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,410
And also we're going to
set a minimum frame size

94
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:19,170
for the content so that you
can not go smaller than that.

95
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:21,930
So here, right after content

96
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:24,580
for the else, so this is for the Mac,

97
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:28,480
we're going to set .frame
parenthesis minWidth: to 800

98
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:33,897
minHeight: to 600.

99
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:38,910
Let's run the app and bring it forward.

100
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:41,410
Now, make sure that you
don't hide the sidebar

101
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:44,710
because it's going to be
very hard to bring it back,

102
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:48,100
which is why we should
definitely set a minimum size

103
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,160
for the sidebar.

104
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,170
So let's go to sidebar.Swift.

105
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:53,810
So let's use the same technique.

106
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:57,450
And also we can not have a
title learn on the sidebar,

107
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:59,120
but it makes sense for iOS.

108
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,640
What I'm going to do is

109
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,270
right after the curly braces of body,

110
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:07,873
I'm going to set var content:

111
00:05:08,926 --> 00:05:12,080
someview, curly braces,

112
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,610
and I'm going to select everything

113
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:17,370
for the list and the modifier list style

114
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:19,000
and navigation title,

115
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,580
command X to cut it and
paste it in content.

116
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,520
Next, I'm going to set my condition.

117
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,767
So #ifos(iOS).

118
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:35,290
we're going to put content
#else, then #andif.

119
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,370
For the content, I'm going
to use the navigation title.

120
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:42,850
So I'm going to cut this

121
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:46,570
and put it right next to content.

122
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:48,300
So this is only for iOS.

123
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,020
And then for the Mac after else,

124
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,740
I'm going to put content.

125
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,970
Then I'm going to set
a modifier for frame.

126
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:57,933
So .frame parenthesis minWidth: 200.

127
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:05,810
Then idealwdith: 250,

128
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:09,390
then maxWidth:300.

129
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:12,070
So ideal width, I believe is pretty new.

130
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:15,750
And if you option click on the name,

131
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,640
you're going to find the documentation.

132
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,060
It's not super helpful here.

133
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:22,290
It just says the ideal height

134
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:24,740
and from my understanding is

135
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:28,650
that if the user hasn't
customized the window,

136
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:30,740
then it's going to show 250.

137
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:31,830
If you run this,

138
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:34,470
you're going to see a minimum width of 200

139
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:36,750
and a maximum of 300.

140
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:40,500
One thing to note is that you
can still hide the sidebar.

141
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,500
Right now, I haven't found
a way to toggle it back.

142
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,060
So one trick that I found to restore it

143
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:49,890
is to simply do courseRow,
right after courseView.

144
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:52,120
So to add a third column.

145
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,920
And then when you run it again,

146
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,490
it's going to show the sidebar.

147
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:58,250
I suspect that this is a beta issue

148
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,920
and will be resolved later.

149
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,830
So let me put it back
without the third column,

150
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,490
which is courseRow.

151
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:05,520
And before we move on,

152
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,090
I just want to point out
that .frame for the content

153
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:12,920
or for the sidebar should not
be used outside of the Mac

154
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,600
because on iOS, it doesn't make sense.

155
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,810
You do have a fixed width for the sidebar

156
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:21,500
and the content should
accommodate the screen size.

157
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,420
In the next session.

158
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:26,220
I want to show you how to
use the new toolbar modifier,

159
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:30,270
and how to organize your files
as your project get bigger.

160
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:33,790
And you want to keep things
clean and easy to navigate.

161
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:36,241
So I'll see you in the next session.

162
00:07:36,241 --> 00:07:37,870
(ding)
