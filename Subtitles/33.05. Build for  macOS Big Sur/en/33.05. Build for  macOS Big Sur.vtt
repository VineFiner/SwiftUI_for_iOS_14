(intense music)

2
00:00:05.583 --> 00:00:08.166
(upbeat music)

3
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.440
<v Meng>Hi and welcome to a fifth session</v>

4
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.130
of my Swift UI course.

5
00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:19.370
So everything we have done so far can be built

6
00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:21.060
for the Mac app as well.

7
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.210
Now, please keep in mind

8
00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.200
that in order to test for the Mac app,

9
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.260
you're going to need Big Slur.

10
00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:28.480
If you don't have it,

11
00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.020
you're going to need to stick to what you see on the iPad,

12
00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.730
as well as the iPhone.

13
00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.290
So for those who have it,

14
00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.070
we're going to switch to Mac OS target,

15
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.860
and we're going to select my Mac.

16
00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.620
Now, as soon as you do that,

17
00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.600
you're going to see that there are some code

18
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.970
that simply don't work for the Mac.

19
00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.600
To solve this we're going to add a condition.

20
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.130
So right before list,

21
00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:59.130
we're going to do #ifos parenthesis iOS,

22
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.040
then right after .navigation,

23
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.880
we're going to set #else,

24
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.717
and then after that #andif.

25
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.800
In order to use this condition at the top level,

26
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.450
we're going to need to add before var body,

27
00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.593
commercial A view builder.

28
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.890
Now, if you do command B, it's going to try to build,

29
00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.910
and the error will disappear.

30
00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:28.743
And by the way,

31
00:01:28.743 --> 00:01:30.850
if you do this at this version of the beta,

32
00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.850
sometimes the code highlighting will stop working

33
00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.140
in some portions, that's normal.

34
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.430
So if you look at the code,

35
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.490
this will run on iOS

36
00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.250
and whatever is in between the else and the andif

37
00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:44.810
will run on the Mac.

38
00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:45.850
But in this case,

39
00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.810
we're going to have to repeat the code

40
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.670
and we want to avoid doing that.

41
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.430
And there's a trick that I learned,

42
00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.620
which is to use many components.

43
00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.490
And to do that we're going to declare

44
00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.520
right after the body curly braces,

45
00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.560
we're going to add var content

46
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.640
of type some view, curly braces.

47
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.570
And this is where we can put the entire code.

48
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.400
So we're going to cut it, command X,

49
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.660
and we're going to move it to the content

50
00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.110
inside the curly braces.

51
00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.030
As a result,

52
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.650
we can reference this mini component called content

53
00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.210
by just typing content.

54
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.570
So I'm going to do that for both places.

55
00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.810
This is for iOS, and this is for Mac OS.

56
00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.530
And then whatever code such as a modifier

57
00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.410
that should only work for iOS.

58
00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.730
I can just cut it by selecting it

59
00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.730
and command X and then paste it just for iOS.

60
00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.850
So this is great for breaking down a huge view

61
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.700
and not having to create a new some view

62
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.170
where you would have to pass data.

63
00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.610
And it's especially useful when you're targeting

64
00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.830
for specific platforms.

65
00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.420
So now, are you ready to run your first Mac OS app?

66
00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.133
Well, let's just click on resume.

67
00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:08.813
And there you go.

68
00:03:08.813 --> 00:03:12.520
So your list UI should look just like this.

69
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.670
If you want to interact with your Mac app,

70
00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.830
you're going to have to click play,

71
00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.760
and then we have to click bring forward.

72
00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.660
So this will create two windows.

73
00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.920
The first one is the X code preview.

74
00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.630
So every time you make a change here,

75
00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.160
it's going to auto update the X code preview.

76
00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.470
The second one is the actual app.

77
00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.190
So if you hide X code,

78
00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.440
you can see that this is your app.

79
00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.680
It has your icon,

80
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.540
it has the sidebar, which is the first view being loaded.

81
00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.430
And remember just like the iPad,

82
00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.440
we have the courses and it goes to the courses view.

83
00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.100
So developing for the Mac, iOS has some slight differences.

84
00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.280
So for example,

85
00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.350
each content space should always have a frame.

86
00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.300
Otherwise you can resize it

87
00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.130
and it's going to hide a bunch of things,

88
00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.300
or you're going to see a tiny window

89
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.440
with a minimum content,

90
00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:07.790
and it's going to look buggy.

91
00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.620
So if you don't need to interact with your Mac app,

92
00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.920
it's just best to stop.

93
00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.410
And also we're going to set a minimum frame size

94
00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.170
for the content so that you can not go smaller than that.

95
00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:21.930
So here, right after content

96
00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.580
for the else, so this is for the Mac,

97
00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.480
we're going to set .frame parenthesis minWidth: to 800

98
00:04:32.397 --> 00:04:33.897
minHeight: to 600.

99
00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.910
Let's run the app and bring it forward.

100
00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.410
Now, make sure that you don't hide the sidebar

101
00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.710
because it's going to be very hard to bring it back,

102
00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.100
which is why we should definitely set a minimum size

103
00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:49.160
for the sidebar.

104
00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.170
So let's go to sidebar.Swift.

105
00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:53.810
So let's use the same technique.

106
00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.450
And also we can not have a title learn on the sidebar,

107
00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.120
but it makes sense for iOS.

108
00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.640
What I'm going to do is

109
00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.270
right after the curly braces of body,

110
00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.873
I'm going to set var content:

111
00:05:08.926 --> 00:05:12.080
someview, curly braces,

112
00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.610
and I'm going to select everything

113
00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.370
for the list and the modifier list style

114
00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.000
and navigation title,

115
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.580
command X to cut it and paste it in content.

116
00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.520
Next, I'm going to set my condition.

117
00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:26.767
So #ifos(iOS).

118
00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:35.290
we're going to put content #else, then #andif.

119
00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:41.370
For the content, I'm going to use the navigation title.

120
00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:42.850
So I'm going to cut this

121
00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.570
and put it right next to content.

122
00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:48.300
So this is only for iOS.

123
00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.020
And then for the Mac after else,

124
00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:52.740
I'm going to put content.

125
00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:54.970
Then I'm going to set a modifier for frame.

126
00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:57.933
So .frame parenthesis minWidth: 200.

127
00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:05.810
Then idealwdith: 250,

128
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:09.390
then maxWidth:300.

129
00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:12.070
So ideal width, I believe is pretty new.

130
00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:15.750
And if you option click on the name,

131
00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:17.640
you're going to find the documentation.

132
00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:19.060
It's not super helpful here.

133
00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:22.290
It just says the ideal height

134
00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:24.740
and from my understanding is

135
00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:28.650
that if the user hasn't customized the window,

136
00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:30.740
then it's going to show 250.

137
00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:31.830
If you run this,

138
00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:34.470
you're going to see a minimum width of 200

139
00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:36.750
and a maximum of 300.

140
00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:40.500
One thing to note is that you can still hide the sidebar.

141
00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:43.500
Right now, I haven't found a way to toggle it back.

142
00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.060
So one trick that I found to restore it

143
00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:49.890
is to simply do courseRow, right after courseView.

144
00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:52.120
So to add a third column.

145
00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.920
And then when you run it again,

146
00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.490
it's going to show the sidebar.

147
00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:58.250
I suspect that this is a beta issue

148
00:06:58.250 --> 00:06:59.920
and will be resolved later.

149
00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.830
So let me put it back without the third column,

150
00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:04.490
which is courseRow.

151
00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:05.520
And before we move on,

152
00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:09.090
I just want to point out that .frame for the content

153
00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:12.920
or for the sidebar should not be used outside of the Mac

154
00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.600
because on iOS, it doesn't make sense.

155
00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:18.810
You do have a fixed width for the sidebar

156
00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:21.500
and the content should accommodate the screen size.

157
00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:22.420
In the next session.

158
00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:26.220
I want to show you how to use the new toolbar modifier,

159
00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:30.270
and how to organize your files as your project get bigger.

160
00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:33.790
And you want to keep things clean and easy to navigate.

161
00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:36.241
So I'll see you in the next session.

162
00:07:36.241 --> 00:07:37.870
(ding)
