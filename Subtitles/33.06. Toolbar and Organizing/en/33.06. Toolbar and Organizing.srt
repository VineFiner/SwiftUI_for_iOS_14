1
00:00:00,725 --> 00:00:03,225
(eerie music)

2
00:00:06,145 --> 00:00:08,728
(upbeat music)

3
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:14,740
- [Meng] Hey there, so we
are on the sixth session

4
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:16,430
of my SwiftUI course.

5
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:18,670
And we're going to discuss the toolbar

6
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:21,000
and how to organize our files.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,700
And this is where we can

8
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:25,883
switch back to iOS for the iPhone 11 Pro,

9
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:30,260
and resume, the toolbar is new this year.

10
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:31,580
And it's going to allow you to

11
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:36,290
put a bunch of buttons
and content in key areas

12
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:37,610
of the platform.

13
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:40,670
So for example, on iOS, you can put it

14
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:44,880
on the navigation bar,
and at the bottom as well.

15
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,270
This is like the navigation bar items,

16
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:50,530
but for cross platform and not restricted

17
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:51,840
to the navbar.

18
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,230
So to use it,

19
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:56,880
I'm going to add a
modifier called .toolbar.

20
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,310
Then you can use the
first auto completion,

21
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:02,650
press Enter and now you
have a toolbar item.

22
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:04,750
And this is where you can put your button

23
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:07,340
or your texts or icons,

24
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:10,250
you can already see in the
top right, it says placeholder

25
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:13,050
so we can just replace that with

26
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:17,290
image parentheses system name,

27
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:22,290
then we're gonna put person.crop.circle.

28
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:26,230
So if you run this, you're
gonna see that it's simply part

29
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:27,063
of the navbar.

30
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:32,070
And thanks to the toolbar, we
can place it anywhere we want.

31
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:35,580
So for example, after toolbar item,

32
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,910
I'm gonna set parentheses and

33
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,940
put placement

34
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,777
column.bottomBar.

35
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:49,480
And so when I do that, it
moved my icon to the bottom.

36
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,610
Depending on the platform and the context,

37
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:53,410
we have a bunch of options.

38
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:54,580
If you wanna know all of them,

39
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:57,610
you can optionally click on bottom bar,

40
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:00,480
open developer documentation.

41
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,530
Click on toolbar item placement.

42
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:06,860
And this is where you're
gonna find a list of places

43
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:10,110
to use depending on platform and context.

44
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,480
So you can see here that

45
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,660
we have navigation bar
leading and trailing.

46
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:19,320
So we can try that navigation bar leading,

47
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,070
and this would be to the top left,

48
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:24,393
then we can change to trailing.

49
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:28,510
And this will go to the top right,

50
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:32,490
and for the Mac, we cannot use
exactly the same placement.

51
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:35,770
So let's copy the modifier toolbar.

52
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:40,330
So Command C, and put it two L's content.

53
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:44,080
And after dot frame, paste
it, you won't see it here.

54
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,423
So we're gonna have to
switch back to the Mac.

55
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:51,320
And now you can see that we
have an error that says that

56
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,160
this is not available in Mac OS.

57
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,110
So we can change this to automatic

58
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,710
and this would be the same as

59
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:00,880
just removing it if you want to.

60
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,430
And now we're gonna click on resume.

61
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:06,130
So once it's run, you can
click on bring forward.

62
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:09,520
And now you can see that
this is your Xcode preview.

63
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,980
And you won't really see

64
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,090
the navbar and the
toolbar and Xcode preview,

65
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:15,090
but definitely for your Mac App,

66
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:17,080
you're gonna see the title.

67
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,660
And thanks to the toolbar
item, it's slightly bigger

68
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,770
and actually more beautiful in my opinion.

69
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,080
So that's really neat.

70
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,810
And now we can put any
type of content here,

71
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:30,340
we can put a text, we can
place it to the left side,

72
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:33,450
and we can even turn this into a button.

73
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:36,380
And Xcode does a pretty
good job at knowing

74
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:39,570
which ones are available
in which platform.

75
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:41,430
So in this case, you're not gonna see

76
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,550
the navigation bar trailing,

77
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:46,700
but I can definitely use
all of these other ones.

78
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:49,300
And if you wanna make it as a button,

79
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,960
we're going to have to
Command click on image.

80
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,680
Let's insert in a vstack first,

81
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,990
and change that to button

82
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:01,050
and then we can put some empty action.

83
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:04,130
Here it says it's missing
it, so we can click on fix.

84
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:08,370
And for action, just put curly braces.

85
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:10,640
Cool, so let's click on bring forward.

86
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,730
And now you can see that
this is now a button,

87
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:14,220
it has a nice frame,

88
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,540
and you can make it interactive later.

89
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:19,550
Awesome, so now let's clean up our project

90
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,950
and add some tweaks for the Mac.

91
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:24,510
So let's go to content view.

92
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:28,020
And so this is the UI that
we created for course item,

93
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:31,070
and so we shouldn't
put it on content view.

94
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,563
Let's create a new file, so Command N,

95
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:37,730
double click on SwiftUI view,

96
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:41,160
type course item, create,

97
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,410
and this is where we're gonna move

98
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:47,620
everything for the
vstack and the modifiers.

99
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,350
So Command X,

100
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,640
we're gonna move that to course item

101
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,570
instead of the text

102
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,760
and save.

103
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,910
We're gonna go back to content view,

104
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:02,040
then we're going to reference
the site bar parentheses.

105
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,940
As for the preview, we
don't need the two previews,

106
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:09,293
we can just keep a single one and resume.

107
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:12,490
At this point, we're
gonna use the content view

108
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:15,490
as the first view that's
going to be loaded.

109
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:17,620
And we're going to include the sidebar

110
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:20,580
and later on the tab bar for iPhone,

111
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:24,000
and then we gonna put
some frame for the Mac.

112
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,750
First of all, we're gonna
need that condition.

113
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:28,636
So pound if

114
00:05:28,636 --> 00:05:31,610
OS parenthesis iOS,

115
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:33,290
after sidebar,

116
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:35,770
pound, else,

117
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:38,830
and then pound and if

118
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:41,863
let's not forget the view builder before.

119
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:45,810
And finally for the Mac,

120
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:48,910
so we're gonna put sidebar parentheses,

121
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:51,460
and we're going to add a frame modifier,

122
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:54,150
and this is where I can
recommend that you should put

123
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:58,410
a minimum width for your entire Mac app.

124
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:01,450
In this case, we can put
it to let's say 1,000

125
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:05,260
and in minimum height to 600.

126
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:07,610
So if you resume your preview,

127
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:11,030
you're gonna see that because
of the size that I have,

128
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:15,100
it can now accommodate and
show me the sidebar correctly.

129
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:18,220
We should also go back
to design code course app

130
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,820
where we're going directly to the sidebar.

131
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,040
And in this case, we should definitely

132
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,070
go to the content view instead.

133
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:26,820
So content view,

134
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,990
speaking about organizing your files

135
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:31,230
and learning SwiftUI in general,

136
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:34,430
definitely go to the WWDC website

137
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:36,210
and click on sample code.

138
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:40,130
So one way that I learned
how to organize my project

139
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:42,170
is by looking at the source code

140
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:44,330
of the Fruta app created by Apple

141
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:47,030
where they're creating
a multi platform app.

142
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:50,260
After you download it
and open the project,

143
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:52,310
you're gonna find that they have

144
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:57,310
the same organization for
shared folder, iOS, Mac OS.

145
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,970
Now where I took a lot of inspiration from

146
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:02,820
is how they're organizing
let's see the data model,

147
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:05,840
the navigation and the components.

148
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,840
Now for the navigation, you
can see here that if it's iOS,

149
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:14,620
it's detecting if it's an iPhone using

150
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,630
horizontal size class,

151
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:18,760
and it's showing the top bar.

152
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,280
Otherwise, for the iPad,

153
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,780
it's going to be the
sidebar, or for the Mac,

154
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:27,030
you can see that it also has a frame size.

155
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,580
Since we don't have a tab bar yet,

156
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:31,330
we don't need to detect
if it's an iPhone or not.

157
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:32,740
Back to our project,

158
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:35,950
let's create a folder for content view.

159
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:39,490
So let's select content
view, right click on it,

160
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:42,290
and new group form selection.

161
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:45,303
This is where we're going to
name that group navigation.

162
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:49,250
Then we're going to move sidebar

163
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,570
and put it inside navigation as well.

164
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:53,330
We don't have data model yet,

165
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:56,000
so we won't be making that folder yet.

166
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,950
But otherwise, let's create
a new folder called items.

167
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:03,100
So let's right click on course item,

168
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,980
new group from selection,

169
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:07,120
we're gonna name this one items.

170
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,110
So in most project,

171
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:10,370
you're gonna see a
folder called components.

172
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:14,270
And usually people put all
the reusable components there,

173
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:16,200
and it tends to get a bit messy.

174
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,140
So what I try to do is to
be a bit more specific.

175
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:22,490
And in this case, four
items, I'm putting everything

176
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:26,070
that can be repeated many
times inside a grid layout,

177
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,520
or a list layout.

178
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,940
So in this case, we have the course item.

179
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:32,800
And we also have the course row.

180
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,870
And then for the screens.

181
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:38,160
I'm just putting it here until
it gets a little bit messy.

182
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,940
And then you can create
a folder called screens.

183
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:44,510
But personally, I like my
screens to be easy to reach

184
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:46,460
from the root.

185
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,020
Because you have the thing that

186
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,430
when people first land on your project,

187
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:52,870
that's the first thing
that they're interested in.

188
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:55,760
And they want to be able
to easily navigate between

189
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,760
the different screens and
then explore to deeper levels.

190
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,640
All right, so before
going to the next session,

191
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,220
I just wanna point out that
when you make a screen,

192
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:08,280
this is where you typically
will have your navigation title.

193
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,710
Also, oftentimes,

194
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:12,400
you don't want to repeat
the navigation view,

195
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,510
otherwise it's going to bug.

196
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:18,160
And that navigation view
has already been included

197
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,670
in the sidebar.

198
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:23,670
So you don't wanna do that
also in the screen itself.

199
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:26,370
Anyways, a lot of this
will come with practice,

200
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:29,160
and we're gonna explore more and more into

201
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,950
how we organize our files.

202
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:32,970
For now what I wanna do is

203
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:36,390
to turn this view into course row.

204
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:39,570
So I'm going to create
a new file Command N

205
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,130
double click on SwiftUI view.

206
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:44,953
Let's name it course list.

207
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:51,490
And we're gonna move all the
code inside courses view,

208
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,380
curly braces.

209
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:56,420
So including view builder body in content,

210
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:59,260
Command X, we're gonna move that

211
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:03,530
to replace by in course list and save.

212
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:05,630
Now back to courses view,

213
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:08,090
we're gonna put the var body

214
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,880
type some view, curly braces.

215
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,480
And this is where we're
gonna start a new view

216
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,633
with text parentheses and
it's going to be empty.

217
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,100
Typically a custom layout
or a general layout

218
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,730
is going to be view at the end.

219
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:28,800
And if it's using a list it's going to be

220
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,790
list at the end for the items
that you're repeating a lot.

221
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:35,270
It's course row or course item.

222
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:38,300
I do realize that reorganizing your files

223
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,140
and folders and refactoring
some of the code

224
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,400
can be scary to a lot of beginners.

225
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,140
So feel free to download the source files

226
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:48,000
and start from my template

227
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,330
and that is valid for any section

228
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:51,970
that you have trouble with.

229
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:56,340
So back to courses view, we're
ready to start a big series

230
00:10:56,340 --> 00:11:01,340
of videos on match geometry
effect as well as lazy grid,

231
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:05,050
we're also going to do a lot
of animations, transitions.

232
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:06,580
It's going to be a lot of fun.

233
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:09,038
So I'll see you, in the next session.

234
00:11:09,038 --> 00:11:10,937
(upbeat music)
