1
00:00:00.725 --> 00:00:03.225
(eerie music)

2
00:00:06.145 --> 00:00:08.728
(upbeat music)

3
00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:14.740
<v Meng>Hey there, so we are on the sixth session</v>

4
00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:16.430
of my SwiftUI course.

5
00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.670
And we're going to discuss the toolbar

6
00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.000
and how to organize our files.

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.700
And this is where we can

8
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.883
switch back to iOS for the iPhone 11 Pro,

9
00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.260
and resume, the toolbar is new this year.

10
00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:31.580
And it's going to allow you to

11
00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.290
put a bunch of buttons and content in key areas

12
00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:37.610
of the platform.

13
00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.670
So for example, on iOS, you can put it

14
00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.880
on the navigation bar, and at the bottom as well.

15
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.270
This is like the navigation bar items,

16
00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.530
but for cross platform and not restricted

17
00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:51.840
to the navbar.

18
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.230
So to use it,

19
00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.880
I'm going to add a modifier called .toolbar.

20
00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.310
Then you can use the first auto completion,

21
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.650
press Enter and now you have a toolbar item.

22
00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:04.750
And this is where you can put your button

23
00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.340
or your texts or icons,

24
00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.250
you can already see in the top right, it says placeholder

25
00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.050
so we can just replace that with

26
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.290
image parentheses system name,

27
00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.290
then we're gonna put person.crop.circle.

28
00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.230
So if you run this, you're gonna see that it's simply part

29
00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:27.063
of the navbar.

30
00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.070
And thanks to the toolbar, we can place it anywhere we want.

31
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.580
So for example, after toolbar item,

32
00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.910
I'm gonna set parentheses and

33
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:39.940
put placement

34
00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.777
column.bottomBar.

35
00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.480
And so when I do that, it moved my icon to the bottom.

36
00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.610
Depending on the platform and the context,

37
00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.410
we have a bunch of options.

38
00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:54.580
If you wanna know all of them,

39
00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.610
you can optionally click on bottom bar,

40
00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.480
open developer documentation.

41
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.530
Click on toolbar item placement.

42
00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.860
And this is where you're gonna find a list of places

43
00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.110
to use depending on platform and context.

44
00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.480
So you can see here that

45
00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.660
we have navigation bar leading and trailing.

46
00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.320
So we can try that navigation bar leading,

47
00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.070
and this would be to the top left,

48
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.393
then we can change to trailing.

49
00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.510
And this will go to the top right,

50
00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.490
and for the Mac, we cannot use exactly the same placement.

51
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.770
So let's copy the modifier toolbar.

52
00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.330
So Command C, and put it two L's content.

53
00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.080
And after dot frame, paste it, you won't see it here.

54
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.423
So we're gonna have to switch back to the Mac.

55
00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.320
And now you can see that we have an error that says that

56
00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.160
this is not available in Mac OS.

57
00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.110
So we can change this to automatic

58
00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.710
and this would be the same as

59
00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.880
just removing it if you want to.

60
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.430
And now we're gonna click on resume.

61
00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.130
So once it's run, you can click on bring forward.

62
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.520
And now you can see that this is your Xcode preview.

63
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.980
And you won't really see

64
00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.090
the navbar and the toolbar and Xcode preview,

65
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.090
but definitely for your Mac App,

66
00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.080
you're gonna see the title.

67
00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.660
And thanks to the toolbar item, it's slightly bigger

68
00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.770
and actually more beautiful in my opinion.

69
00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.080
So that's really neat.

70
00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.810
And now we can put any type of content here,

71
00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.340
we can put a text, we can place it to the left side,

72
00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.450
and we can even turn this into a button.

73
00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.380
And Xcode does a pretty good job at knowing

74
00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.570
which ones are available in which platform.

75
00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.430
So in this case, you're not gonna see

76
00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.550
the navigation bar trailing,

77
00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.700
but I can definitely use all of these other ones.

78
00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.300
And if you wanna make it as a button,

79
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.960
we're going to have to Command click on image.

80
00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.680
Let's insert in a vstack first,

81
00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.990
and change that to button

82
00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.050
and then we can put some empty action.

83
00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.130
Here it says it's missing it, so we can click on fix.

84
00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.370
And for action, just put curly braces.

85
00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.640
Cool, so let's click on bring forward.

86
00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.730
And now you can see that this is now a button,

87
00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:14.220
it has a nice frame,

88
00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.540
and you can make it interactive later.

89
00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.550
Awesome, so now let's clean up our project

90
00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:21.950
and add some tweaks for the Mac.

91
00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.510
So let's go to content view.

92
00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.020
And so this is the UI that we created for course item,

93
00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.070
and so we shouldn't put it on content view.

94
00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.563
Let's create a new file, so Command N,

95
00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.730
double click on SwiftUI view,

96
00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:41.160
type course item, create,

97
00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.410
and this is where we're gonna move

98
00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.620
everything for the vstack and the modifiers.

99
00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.350
So Command X,

100
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.640
we're gonna move that to course item

101
00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.570
instead of the text

102
00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:55.760
and save.

103
00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.910
We're gonna go back to content view,

104
00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:02.040
then we're going to reference the site bar parentheses.

105
00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.940
As for the preview, we don't need the two previews,

106
00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.293
we can just keep a single one and resume.

107
00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.490
At this point, we're gonna use the content view

108
00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.490
as the first view that's going to be loaded.

109
00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.620
And we're going to include the sidebar

110
00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.580
and later on the tab bar for iPhone,

111
00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.000
and then we gonna put some frame for the Mac.

112
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.750
First of all, we're gonna need that condition.

113
00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.636
So pound if

114
00:05:28.636 --> 00:05:31.610
OS parenthesis iOS,

115
00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.290
after sidebar,

116
00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:35.770
pound, else,

117
00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.830
and then pound and if

118
00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.863
let's not forget the view builder before.

119
00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.810
And finally for the Mac,

120
00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.910
so we're gonna put sidebar parentheses,

121
00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:51.460
and we're going to add a frame modifier,

122
00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.150
and this is where I can recommend that you should put

123
00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:58.410
a minimum width for your entire Mac app.

124
00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:01.450
In this case, we can put it to let's say 1,000

125
00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:05.260
and in minimum height to 600.

126
00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.610
So if you resume your preview,

127
00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:11.030
you're gonna see that because of the size that I have,

128
00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:15.100
it can now accommodate and show me the sidebar correctly.

129
00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:18.220
We should also go back to design code course app

130
00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:20.820
where we're going directly to the sidebar.

131
00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:23.040
And in this case, we should definitely

132
00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.070
go to the content view instead.

133
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:26.820
So content view,

134
00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:28.990
speaking about organizing your files

135
00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:31.230
and learning SwiftUI in general,

136
00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:34.430
definitely go to the WWDC website

137
00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:36.210
and click on sample code.

138
00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:40.130
So one way that I learned how to organize my project

139
00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:42.170
is by looking at the source code

140
00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:44.330
of the Fruta app created by Apple

141
00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:47.030
where they're creating a multi platform app.

142
00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:50.260
After you download it and open the project,

143
00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.310
you're gonna find that they have

144
00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:57.310
the same organization for shared folder, iOS, Mac OS.

145
00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.970
Now where I took a lot of inspiration from

146
00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:02.820
is how they're organizing let's see the data model,

147
00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:05.840
the navigation and the components.

148
00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:10.840
Now for the navigation, you can see here that if it's iOS,

149
00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:14.620
it's detecting if it's an iPhone using

150
00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:16.630
horizontal size class,

151
00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:18.760
and it's showing the top bar.

152
00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.280
Otherwise, for the iPad,

153
00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:23.780
it's going to be the sidebar, or for the Mac,

154
00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:27.030
you can see that it also has a frame size.

155
00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:28.580
Since we don't have a tab bar yet,

156
00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:31.330
we don't need to detect if it's an iPhone or not.

157
00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:32.740
Back to our project,

158
00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:35.950
let's create a folder for content view.

159
00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:39.490
So let's select content view, right click on it,

160
00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:42.290
and new group form selection.

161
00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:45.303
This is where we're going to name that group navigation.

162
00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:49.250
Then we're going to move sidebar

163
00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:51.570
and put it inside navigation as well.

164
00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:53.330
We don't have data model yet,

165
00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:56.000
so we won't be making that folder yet.

166
00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.950
But otherwise, let's create a new folder called items.

167
00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:03.100
So let's right click on course item,

168
00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:04.980
new group from selection,

169
00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:07.120
we're gonna name this one items.

170
00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.110
So in most project,

171
00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:10.370
you're gonna see a folder called components.

172
00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:14.270
And usually people put all the reusable components there,

173
00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:16.200
and it tends to get a bit messy.

174
00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:19.140
So what I try to do is to be a bit more specific.

175
00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:22.490
And in this case, four items, I'm putting everything

176
00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:26.070
that can be repeated many times inside a grid layout,

177
00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:27.520
or a list layout.

178
00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:29.940
So in this case, we have the course item.

179
00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:32.800
And we also have the course row.

180
00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:34.870
And then for the screens.

181
00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:38.160
I'm just putting it here until it gets a little bit messy.

182
00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:40.940
And then you can create a folder called screens.

183
00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:44.510
But personally, I like my screens to be easy to reach

184
00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:46.460
from the root.

185
00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:48.020
Because you have the thing that

186
00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:50.430
when people first land on your project,

187
00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:52.870
that's the first thing that they're interested in.

188
00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:55.760
And they want to be able to easily navigate between

189
00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:59.760
the different screens and then explore to deeper levels.

190
00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:01.640
All right, so before going to the next session,

191
00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:04.220
I just wanna point out that when you make a screen,

192
00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:08.280
this is where you typically will have your navigation title.

193
00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:09.710
Also, oftentimes,

194
00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:12.400
you don't want to repeat the navigation view,

195
00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:14.510
otherwise it's going to bug.

196
00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:18.160
And that navigation view has already been included

197
00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:19.670
in the sidebar.

198
00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:23.670
So you don't wanna do that also in the screen itself.

199
00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:26.370
Anyways, a lot of this will come with practice,

200
00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:29.160
and we're gonna explore more and more into

201
00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:30.950
how we organize our files.

202
00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:32.970
For now what I wanna do is

203
00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:36.390
to turn this view into course row.

204
00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:39.570
So I'm going to create a new file Command N

205
00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:43.130
double click on SwiftUI view.

206
00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:44.953
Let's name it course list.

207
00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:51.490
And we're gonna move all the code inside courses view,

208
00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:53.380
curly braces.

209
00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:56.420
So including view builder body in content,

210
00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:59.260
Command X, we're gonna move that

211
00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:03.530
to replace by in course list and save.

212
00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:05.630
Now back to courses view,

213
00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:08.090
we're gonna put the var body

214
00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:12.880
type some view, curly braces.

215
00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:15.480
And this is where we're gonna start a new view

216
00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:18.633
with text parentheses and it's going to be empty.

217
00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:23.100
Typically a custom layout or a general layout

218
00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:25.730
is going to be view at the end.

219
00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:28.800
And if it's using a list it's going to be

220
00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:32.790
list at the end for the items that you're repeating a lot.

221
00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:35.270
It's course row or course item.

222
00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:38.300
I do realize that reorganizing your files

223
00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:41.140
and folders and refactoring some of the code

224
00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:43.400
can be scary to a lot of beginners.

225
00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:46.140
So feel free to download the source files

226
00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:48.000
and start from my template

227
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.330
and that is valid for any section

228
00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:51.970
that you have trouble with.

229
00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:56.340
So back to courses view, we're ready to start a big series

230
00:10:56.340 --> 00:11:01.340
of videos on match geometry effect as well as lazy grid,

231
00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:05.050
we're also going to do a lot of animations, transitions.

232
00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:06.580
It's going to be a lot of fun.

233
00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:09.038
So I'll see you, in the next session.

234
00:11:09.038 --> 00:11:10.937
(upbeat music)
