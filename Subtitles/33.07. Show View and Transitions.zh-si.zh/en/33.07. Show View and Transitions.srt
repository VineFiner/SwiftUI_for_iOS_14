00:00:05,937 --> 00:00:08,520
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:13,443
- [Meng] Hey there,

3
00:00:13,443 --> 00:00:16,040
welcome to my SwiftUI
course session seven.

4
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,910
Today we're gonna start
a long series of videos

5
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:21,000
around matched geometry.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,370
Along the way, we're gonna
learn a bunch of new techniques

7
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:27,230
such as asymmetric
transition, selection state,

8
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:29,250
lazyGrid, etcetera.

9
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:33,710
First of all, let's start
by switching to iOS.

10
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:36,870
I'm gonna select iPhone 11 for preview,

11
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,250
so click on resume.

12
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,700
Instead of the text here,

13
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:43,010
we're gonna put CourseItem parentheses.

14
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:45,960
So this is the cart design
that we have created earlier.

15
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,350
And now we're gonna set a fixed frame,

16
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:53,350
so dot frame with a width
of 335 and a height of 250.

17
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:59,080
Now what we want to do is
when we tap on this cart

18
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,000
is gonna show up full screen view.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,040
In order to do that,

20
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:06,260
we're gonna have to place
this CourseItem inside

21
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:11,260
a VStack first and change
from VStack to ZStack.

22
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:15,070
This will allow us to have
many carts on top of each other

23
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:16,190
three dimensionally,

24
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:19,970
instead of stacking
vertically or horizontally.

25
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:23,110
Now we're gonna set the new view

26
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:26,460
CourseItem parentheses,

27
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,280
then we're gonna make
sure that this new view

28
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,670
is not shown by default.

29
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:32,420
So we're gonna have to set a state.

30
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:37,490
State var show is equal to false.

31
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:41,500
Then we're gonna add a condition
for the second course item.

32
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,330
Let's wrap it inside a VStack first,

33
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:47,543
and change from VStack to if show.

34
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,360
Whenever you update your variables,

35
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,660
you're gonna have to resume the preview.

36
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,300
And when you do that,

37
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:58,720
then the full screen will
be not shown by defaults.

38
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,360
Let's add a tap gesture,

39
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,570
so that when we tap on this cart,

40
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:05,410
it's gonna show the full screen.

41
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:08,323
Let's place that for the
ZStack, so everything.

42
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,580
So after ZStack dot TapGesture,

43
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,350
and this is where we're gonna type

44
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:17,850
show dot toggle parentheses.

45
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:21,160
This will ensure that every
time that we tap on the cart,

46
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,980
it's gonna switch between true and false.

47
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,283
Let's click on play.

48
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:30,000
And now when we tap the
cart, it switch to full mode.

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,960
And again, back and forth.

50
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,940
Of course, we're gonna need to transition,

51
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:36,683
so we can set dot animation,

52
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:40,980
and by default is gonna set to easeIn,

53
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:45,560
which creates a simple
fade in fade out animation.

54
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,470
If you want to customize this transition,

55
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:51,130
you're going to need to place a modifier

56
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:55,530
on the first parent
container inside the if show.

57
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:59,920
So let's put dot transition.

58
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,380
And here, if you type dot,

59
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,910
you have a bunch of options,

60
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:06,700
such as opacity, which is by default.

61
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,723
But otherwise, you also have slide.

62
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:12,050
And here, it's gonna slide from the left,

63
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:13,670
and then move to the right.

64
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:15,050
Now, what you're noticing here,

65
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:18,160
is that when you do the transition out,

66
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,430
then suddenly the cart
goes behind the first cart,

67
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,020
and that's not what we want.

68
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:25,600
Normally, you would solve
this using a zIndex,

69
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,920
such as dot zIndex.

70
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,840
Insert a value of one.

71
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,040
But during this beta,

72
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,190
it seems to be a little bit buggy,

73
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:36,810
especially when you click multiple times.

74
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:40,240
And don't worry, we're gonna
explore zIndex more later.

75
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,270
But a quick solution that I found.

76
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:44,803
So I'm gonna remove the
zIndex, so now its smooth.

77
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:49,220
Is to put the if show inside a VStack.

78
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:53,810
So let's put the Vstack, curly braces,

79
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:57,370
and I'm gonna cut everything
for the if statement

80
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,920
and paste it inside the VStack.

81
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,320
If you do this,

82
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:05,550
then your new view is
gonna always be on top.

83
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:09,323
And now we can explore the
other transitions such as scale.

84
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,863
And this is what it looks like.

85
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,730
Then a very useful one

86
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:18,570
is to use move using one of the edges.

87
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:22,150
A common transition is from trailing,

88
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:24,120
which means from the right,

89
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,110
and so, it's a screen
that goes from the right

90
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,860
and then that hides back.

91
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:32,140
If you want your full
screen to not be restricted

92
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,670
by the safe area,

93
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:36,080
then you can add a modifier

94
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,400
dot edgeIgnoringSafeArea dot all.

95
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,070
So now you're going to see
a beautiful full screen mode

96
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:45,210
that slide from the right.

97
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:48,850
And we can change from which
direction it comes from.

98
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:52,180
Bottom is also very common, like this,

99
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:55,030
almost like a modal but
without the stacking carts

100
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:57,320
as well as the gesture.

101
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,420
At the same time, unlike the modal,

102
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:03,400
these trends additions
are very customizable.

103
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,420
I can also put it from leading,
which is from the left.

104
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,390
And then in terms of animation,

105
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:12,790
we can change to easeIn out.

106
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:14,710
So that means that it's gonna be slow

107
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:17,563
at the beginning of the
animation and at the end.

108
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:22,130
And a lot more options such
as duration, delay, repeat,

109
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:26,020
which I explore quite a
lot in my previous course.

110
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:29,470
For now, let's focus on
spring, which is really neat,

111
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:32,460
because it's going to bounce a little bit.

112
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:36,360
It gives us that effect
that you see a lot on iOS.

113
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,660
But I do want to point out that

114
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:40,740
while this is a good way
to set up the animation,

115
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,670
you can also do it during the action.

116
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:48,670
So here I'm gonna type
withAnimation curly braces,

117
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:53,070
and I'm gonna bring show
dot toggle inside it.

118
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:56,580
Let's disable dot animation modifier

119
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,660
and just focus on withAnimation.

120
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:02,640
Now I just wanna point
out that in the preview,

121
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,280
it's going to appear instantly,

122
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,560
and then disappear correctly.

123
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,010
But that's not the case
when you run the app.

124
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:12,260
In iOS simulator,

125
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:15,290
you're gonna see that
the animation is correct.

126
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:17,940
So the reason why I'm exploring both here

127
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,110
is to give you options,

128
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:22,520
but also because this is
the correct way to do it

129
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,743
when you're using matched geometry effect.

130
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,193
Let me resume this.

131
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,093
Then again,

132
00:06:29,093 --> 00:06:31,860
you can see that when I click
first it instantly appear,

133
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:35,150
but when I click multiple
times, it runs fine.

134
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:39,320
So that's just to keep in mind
with withAnimation correctly.

135
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,420
If you want to add the animation timing

136
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:44,720
is gonna be parenthesis,
after withAnimation,

137
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,830
so dot spring parentheses.

138
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:51,210
Another thing to note is that
when you use withAnimation,

139
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:53,900
the timing might be a
little bit different.

140
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,930
So the speed of the animation

141
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:58,710
versus using dot animation modifier.

142
00:06:58,710 --> 00:06:59,543
So with this,

143
00:06:59,543 --> 00:07:02,110
you should have a to
create a preset animation

144
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:03,700
between screens,

145
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:06,040
and this is gonna work across platform

146
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,420
including the Mac and iPad.

147
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,050
In the next session,

148
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:12,130
we're gonna use matched geometry effect.

149
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:14,360
And we're gonna be able
to compare the difference

150
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,170
between having a preset transition

151
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:20,140
versus transitioning shared elements

152
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,360
using matched geometry effect.

153
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,253
So I'll see you in the next session.
