00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,970
- [Meng] Hi, welcome back to session eight

2
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:16,850
of my SwiftUI course.

3
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:21,810
So the big animation tool that
we have access to for iOS 14

4
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:23,770
is called matched geometry effect.

5
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:26,740
And this is going to allow
us to animate shared elements

6
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:29,580
between two views, seamlessly.

7
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:30,413
To do that,

8
00:00:30,413 --> 00:00:31,780
you're going to need to set

9
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:34,890
the matched geometry effect modifier,

10
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:37,250
and we're going to tag
the shared elements.

11
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:38,520
In this case,

12
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,930
we have the CourseItem,

13
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:43,340
which is exactly the same
in the full screen mode.

14
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,180
For the first CourseItem,

15
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,360
it is very important that you put

16
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,840
matched geometry effect
modifier before the frame.

17
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:55,300
So dot matchedGeometryEffect, Enter.

18
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:59,300
And here we need to enter
an ID and then a NameSpace.

19
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,570
For the ID, we're simply
going to put a card.

20
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:04,710
And for the NameSpace,

21
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:09,710
we're going to have to declare,
Namespace var namespace.

22
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,470
So from what I understand the
Namespace is where you set

23
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:17,110
a collection of match elements.

24
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:21,010
So, let's put Namespace in the modifier.

25
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:24,440
And then we can just copy this modifier

26
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:28,943
and put that on the second
CourseItem in full screen mode.

27
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,203
Let's resume this.

28
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:33,700
Click on the card.

29
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:37,200
You see that only the transition
out is working correctly.

30
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,823
So to solve this issue,

31
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:43,113
we're going to set another
property called isSource.

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And here we want to know which
of the cards is the original.

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,300
So, you can look at the
documentation by option clicking

34
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,560
and you have a little bit more explanation

35
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,900
of what's going on.

36
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,860
So we have isSource

37
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:59,480
and what are we going to do here,

38
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,473
is to use the show state.

39
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,210
So show.

40
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:06,460
And then we want this to be true.

41
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:11,140
So we're going to add
exclamation point in front.

42
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,530
Now when you click on it,

43
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:15,090
it does that beautiful transition.

44
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:19,370
We just have a bit of an issue
with the transition move.

45
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:24,370
So we can change from move to
the default opacity instead.

46
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:29,190
And voila, now we have
a perfect transition.

47
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:32,080
So from what I understand show is false.

48
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,260
So we use an exclamation
point to make it true.

49
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,140
But at the same time,

50
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:39,440
this has to be the state
because in full screen mode,

51
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,890
this first card is no longer the source.

52
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:45,440
So therefore this becomes false.

53
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,900
And the full screen
card becomes the source,

54
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,930
which means that now we
can switch back and forth,

55
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:53,160
and it transitions beautifully.

56
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,270
So this animation is very customizable.

57
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,103
So for example,

58
00:02:57,103 --> 00:02:59,740
for Course Item in the full screen mode,

59
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:04,470
we're gonna set dot frame after
the matched geometry effect,

60
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:08,760
parentheses height of 300.

61
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,960
When I do that,

62
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,560
it's not gonna take the full height.

63
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,810
And what is interesting here

64
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:17,030
is that I can set any type
of content that I want

65
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,780
in my full screen mode,

66
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:22,070
and matched geometry is going
to take care of transitioning

67
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:24,560
between the two CourseItem views.

68
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,700
So for example,

69
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:28,260
I can make my full
screen to be scrollable.

70
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,620
So Command click on CourseItem,

71
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,650
let's put this into a Vstack

72
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:35,653
and change from VStack to scroll view.

73
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:37,920
So when you do that,

74
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,000
you can see that I'm transitioning,

75
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,570
and now I can scroll my content.

76
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:46,670
Just make sure that the
edgeIgnoringSafeArea

77
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:49,530
is placed on the scroll view instead.

78
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,960
and the same for the transition.

79
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,890
So the transition will only work

80
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:58,130
on the first parent container
inside the if show statement.

81
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:01,690
Let's add some more content
right after the cover,

82
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:03,090
so the CourseItem.

83
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:06,383
We're gonna put CourseRow parentheses,

84
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:08,840
and now it's right here.

85
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,400
You can see that the CourseRow is using

86
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,230
the opacity transition,

87
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:16,810
while the CourseItem is using
matched geometry effect.

88
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:20,810
To make the content scrollable,
we're gonna set this repeat.

89
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:23,760
So, Command click, click on Repeat.

90
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,910
And instead of maximum five,

91
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:28,110
we're going to set to 20.

92
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:31,760
Now our content is scrollable,
which is really awesome.

93
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,860
And why don't we add some padding as well.

94
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:36,200
So, Command click for each,

95
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,020
put this inside a VStack,

96
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:42,030
and right after the VStack,
set dot padding parentheses,

97
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:42,900
awesome.

98
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,850
So it's starting to look like a real UI.

99
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:48,173
The animation is cancelable
and the content is scrollable.

100
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:54,560
Now back to the topic of
animation versus withAnimation.

101
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:58,260
So if I disable
withAnimation by commenting

102
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:02,870
and putting back the animation modifier,

103
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:06,290
you're gonna see that the
animation is much slower,

104
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:07,200
but at least it works.

105
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,440
It doesn't instantly show the transition.

106
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,200
But why I said withAnimation is better

107
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,610
is because there's a lag.

108
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:17,930
So you can see that when I scroll,

109
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:21,670
the card that is behind
is trying to catch up.

110
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:23,910
And so that is less than ideal.

111
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:26,800
When it comes to using
marched geometry effect,

112
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,400
I believe that for now,

113
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,720
it's better to use withAnimation.

114
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,610
So I can just delete the
dot animation modifier.

115
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:36,620
I know it looks really easy right now,

116
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,980
but yes, it's going to get
a lot more interesting,

117
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,650
especially when you
deal with a lot of cards

118
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:44,430
that have to match different elements.

119
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:46,130
Before we move to the next session,

120
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:48,100
we can remove this VStack container

121
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,290
because we don't have a
back hard problem anymore.

122
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:54,660
So make sure to double
click on the curly braces

123
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,170
and you know where you can delete it.

124
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:00,340
So, I'm going to delete the end first,

125
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:01,883
and then the beginning after.

126
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:06,900
Let me fix my indentation
by selecting the whole thing

127
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,480
and control I.

128
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,460
In the next session,

129
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:13,830
I want to show you how to
create a delay transition

130
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:16,700
so that we have the card showing first,

131
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,990
and then the content showing second.

132
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:20,863
So I'll see you in our next session.
