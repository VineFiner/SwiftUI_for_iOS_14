00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.970
<v Meng>Hi, welcome back to session eight</v>

2
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:16.850
of my SwiftUI course.

3
00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.810
So the big animation tool that we have access to for iOS 14

4
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.770
is called matched geometry effect.

5
00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.740
And this is going to allow us to animate shared elements

6
00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.580
between two views, seamlessly.

7
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.413
To do that,

8
00:00:30.413 --> 00:00:31.780
you're going to need to set

9
00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.890
the matched geometry effect modifier,

10
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.250
and we're going to tag the shared elements.

11
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:38.520
In this case,

12
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.930
we have the CourseItem,

13
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.340
which is exactly the same in the full screen mode.

14
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.180
For the first CourseItem,

15
00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.360
it is very important that you put

16
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.840
matched geometry effect modifier before the frame.

17
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.300
So dot matchedGeometryEffect, Enter.

18
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.300
And here we need to enter an ID and then a NameSpace.

19
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.570
For the ID, we're simply going to put a card.

20
00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.710
And for the NameSpace,

21
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.710
we're going to have to declare, Namespace var namespace.

22
00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.470
So from what I understand the Namespace is where you set

23
00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.110
a collection of match elements.

24
00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.010
So, let's put Namespace in the modifier.

25
00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.440
And then we can just copy this modifier

26
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.943
and put that on the second CourseItem in full screen mode.

27
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.203
Let's resume this.

28
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:33.700
Click on the card.

29
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.200
You see that only the transition out is working correctly.

30
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.823
So to solve this issue,

31
00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.113
we're going to set another property called isSource.

32
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
And here we want to know which of the cards is the original.

33
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.300
So, you can look at the documentation by option clicking

34
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.560
and you have a little bit more explanation

35
00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.900
of what's going on.

36
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.860
So we have isSource

37
00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.480
and what are we going to do here,

38
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.473
is to use the show state.

39
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.210
So show.

40
00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.460
And then we want this to be true.

41
00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.140
So we're going to add exclamation point in front.

42
00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.530
Now when you click on it,

43
00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.090
it does that beautiful transition.

44
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.370
We just have a bit of an issue with the transition move.

45
00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.370
So we can change from move to the default opacity instead.

46
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.190
And voila, now we have a perfect transition.

47
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.080
So from what I understand show is false.

48
00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.260
So we use an exclamation point to make it true.

49
00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.140
But at the same time,

50
00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.440
this has to be the state because in full screen mode,

51
00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.890
this first card is no longer the source.

52
00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.440
So therefore this becomes false.

53
00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.900
And the full screen card becomes the source,

54
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.930
which means that now we can switch back and forth,

55
00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.160
and it transitions beautifully.

56
00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.270
So this animation is very customizable.

57
00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:57.103
So for example,

58
00:02:57.103 --> 00:02:59.740
for Course Item in the full screen mode,

59
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:04.470
we're gonna set dot frame after the matched geometry effect,

60
00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.760
parentheses height of 300.

61
00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:09.960
When I do that,

62
00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.560
it's not gonna take the full height.

63
00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.810
And what is interesting here

64
00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.030
is that I can set any type of content that I want

65
00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.780
in my full screen mode,

66
00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.070
and matched geometry is going to take care of transitioning

67
00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.560
between the two CourseItem views.

68
00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.700
So for example,

69
00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.260
I can make my full screen to be scrollable.

70
00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.620
So Command click on CourseItem,

71
00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.650
let's put this into a Vstack

72
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.653
and change from VStack to scroll view.

73
00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:37.920
So when you do that,

74
00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.000
you can see that I'm transitioning,

75
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.570
and now I can scroll my content.

76
00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.670
Just make sure that the edgeIgnoringSafeArea

77
00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.530
is placed on the scroll view instead.

78
00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.960
and the same for the transition.

79
00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.890
So the transition will only work

80
00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.130
on the first parent container inside the if show statement.

81
00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.690
Let's add some more content right after the cover,

82
00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.090
so the CourseItem.

83
00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.383
We're gonna put CourseRow parentheses,

84
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:08.840
and now it's right here.

85
00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.400
You can see that the CourseRow is using

86
00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.230
the opacity transition,

87
00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.810
while the CourseItem is using matched geometry effect.

88
00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.810
To make the content scrollable, we're gonna set this repeat.

89
00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.760
So, Command click, click on Repeat.

90
00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.910
And instead of maximum five,

91
00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.110
we're going to set to 20.

92
00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.760
Now our content is scrollable, which is really awesome.

93
00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.860
And why don't we add some padding as well.

94
00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.200
So, Command click for each,

95
00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.020
put this inside a VStack,

96
00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.030
and right after the VStack, set dot padding parentheses,

97
00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:42.900
awesome.

98
00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.850
So it's starting to look like a real UI.

99
00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:48.173
The animation is cancelable and the content is scrollable.

100
00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.560
Now back to the topic of animation versus withAnimation.

101
00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.260
So if I disable withAnimation by commenting

102
00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.870
and putting back the animation modifier,

103
00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.290
you're gonna see that the animation is much slower,

104
00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:07.200
but at least it works.

105
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.440
It doesn't instantly show the transition.

106
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.200
But why I said withAnimation is better

107
00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.610
is because there's a lag.

108
00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.930
So you can see that when I scroll,

109
00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.670
the card that is behind is trying to catch up.

110
00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:23.910
And so that is less than ideal.

111
00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:26.800
When it comes to using marched geometry effect,

112
00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.400
I believe that for now,

113
00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.720
it's better to use withAnimation.

114
00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.610
So I can just delete the dot animation modifier.

115
00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.620
I know it looks really easy right now,

116
00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.980
but yes, it's going to get a lot more interesting,

117
00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:41.650
especially when you deal with a lot of cards

118
00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.430
that have to match different elements.

119
00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:46.130
Before we move to the next session,

120
00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:48.100
we can remove this VStack container

121
00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:51.290
because we don't have a back hard problem anymore.

122
00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:54.660
So make sure to double click on the curly braces

123
00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.170
and you know where you can delete it.

124
00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:00.340
So, I'm going to delete the end first,

125
00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:01.883
and then the beginning after.

126
00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:06.900
Let me fix my indentation by selecting the whole thing

127
00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.480
and control I.

128
00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:10.460
In the next session,

129
00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.830
I want to show you how to create a delay transition

130
00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:16.700
so that we have the card showing first,

131
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.990
and then the content showing second.

132
00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:20.863
So I'll see you in our next session.
