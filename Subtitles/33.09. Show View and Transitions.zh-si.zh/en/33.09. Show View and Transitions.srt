00:00:00,749 --> 00:00:03,332
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,500
- [Meng] Hi and welcome
back to session nine

3
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,050
of my Swift UI course.

4
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:18,710
Today, we're gonna look
into delayed transition

5
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:20,710
and asymmetric transition

6
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:23,410
so that we can open this card,

7
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:24,870
and before even showing the content,

8
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:27,490
which is kind of
overlapping with the card,

9
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:28,700
it's going to wait.

10
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,300
So it's gonna show the card first,

11
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,560
and then the content later.

12
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,290
If you scroll down a little bit

13
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:38,890
and look at the transition
and replace .opacity with dot,

14
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:42,270
you're gonna find more
options such as asymmetric,

15
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:47,130
and then you can see that
the type is AnyTransition.

16
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,840
Now, what is interesting here

17
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,910
is that you can set the animation timing

18
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:53,740
for your transition.

19
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:57,210
So to do that, we're going to remove dot

20
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:01,580
and put AnyTransition.opacity

21
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:04,840
.animation.

22
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,570
And this is where we can
set the animation timing.

23
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:09,877
In this case, we're gonna use .spring(),

24
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:13,920
and because we're using .animation,

25
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,510
we can also set multiple
animation options.

26
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:20,200
So if you set the value type

27
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,520
Animation with capital A,

28
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,460
you're gonna be able

29
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,723
to set after .spring().delay

30
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,780
and set it to 0.3, for example.

31
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:33,870
Let me indent the code a little bit.

32
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:37,730
So we have the transition
and then for this transition,

33
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:41,120
we have multiple options such
as what kind of transition?

34
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,830
In this case, it's opacity.

35
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:47,600
And for that transition, we
have the animation timing.

36
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,530
Then for the animation timing,

37
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,890
we have the spring behavior,

38
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:56,080
but also we added a delay of 0.3 seconds.

39
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,860
And I can just put this on the next line.

40
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:03,120
So this is my entire transition
with all of these options.

41
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,550
To make it more readable
lemme just maximize this

42
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:07,720
and let's test this.

43
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,290
So I click here and you can see

44
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:15,100
that the content is waiting
0.3 seconds before showing up.

45
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:18,490
But the problem is, this goes both ways,

46
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:21,420
both transition in and transition out.

47
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:25,300
So when I go back, it's
also waiting 0.3 seconds.

48
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:28,220
As a result, you can see
that both transition in

49
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,100
and out are symmetrical.

50
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,540
So to solve this,

51
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:34,830
we're gonna use asymmetrical transition.

52
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:39,760
So right before AnyTransition,
I'm going to do, dot,

53
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,660
and then here we can see asymmetric.

54
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,290
So we're gonna select this,

55
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:45,470
double click it,

56
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:48,360
and you can see that it
is expecting AnyTransition

57
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,810
for both insertion and removal.

58
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:56,810
So let me cut the whole
AnyTransition with these modifiers.

59
00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:01,923
So command + X, and I'm
going to replace insertion.

60
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:06,930
Let's put insertion in its own line,

61
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:09,320
as well as removal.

62
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,270
And now we can also paste

63
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:14,690
for the other AnyTransition.

64
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:17,640
But for the second one,
which is the removal,

65
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,070
this is where we can remove .delay.

66
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:25,080
So remove .delay, including
the parentheses as well.

67
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,240
And since we only have a single option,

68
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,730
we don't need the value type anymore.

69
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:33,180
So now we have opacity
and the animation timing.

70
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,190
That's pretty cool.

71
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:36,250
So now when I transition in,

72
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,340
you can see that the content is waiting.

73
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,770
When I transition out,
it disappears instantly.

74
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:44,010
Using this technique,
you're going to be able

75
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:46,020
to have different animation timings

76
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,170
between transition in and out.

77
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:51,610
So let me just fix the indentation here

78
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:54,340
and then remove this extra space.

79
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:57,650
This is where we can start
having multiple cards

80
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:59,780
and see what kind of complexity

81
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,410
that we're gonna run into.

82
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:04,080
First of all, let's create a V stack,

83
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,200
so that we can have a second card.

84
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,900
So clicking on a first course item,

85
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,830
embed that in a V stack.

86
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:13,663
And then right after
the first course item,

87
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:17,970
create another course item, parentheses.

88
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,290
Let's use the same size.

89
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:22,260
So let's copy .frame modifier

90
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,730
and apply that to the second card.

91
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:26,150
Let's add a bit of spacing.

92
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:30,317
So parentheses for the
V stack, spacing 220.

93
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:34,760
So when we click on the card,

94
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,230
it's gonna show the full screen,

95
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:39,520
but only between the first course item

96
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,660
and the full screen course item.

97
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,330
And that's because they're a match.

98
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:47,050
So the first course item has an ID card

99
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:50,710
and this full view course
item has the same ID.

100
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:54,390
You can imagine that if we
have, let's say 20 cards,

101
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:58,180
each of those cards will
have to have a unique ID

102
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:02,410
and that unique ID has to
match the full screen ID.

103
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:04,870
So that's where having multiple cards

104
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:07,270
using matched symmetry
can get pretty complex

105
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:09,220
and it's not matched symmetry's fault.

106
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:12,190
It's just the way we wanna
set up the animations

107
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:16,110
and the transitions that
requires a lot of setup.

108
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:16,943
But don't worry,

109
00:05:16,943 --> 00:05:19,270
we're going to try the
simplest route possible

110
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:22,380
while keeping all the powerful features.

111
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,880
Before we move to the next session,

112
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,840
let's fix the background color

113
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,470
so that it doesn't seem
overlapping like this.

114
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:31,280
We're gonna go to the scroll view,

115
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,670
and at the end of it,
before the transition,

116
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:35,760
we're gonna set .background.

117
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,210
We're gonna use one of our color assets.

118
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:42,840
So color, parentheses, it's
going to be Background 1.

119
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,160
We set up Background 1 to
be white for light mode

120
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,380
and black for dark mode.

121
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:50,030
So now when we go to full screen,

122
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:52,300
you can see that the content is scrollable

123
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,270
and it's not overlapping anymore.

124
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:57,310
Next, we're gonna make
this main screen of cards

125
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:59,180
to be scrollable as well.

126
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:02,040
So let's command click on V stack

127
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,220
and embed in V stack

128
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:07,133
and replace by a scroll view.

129
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,620
Now the content is scrollable,

130
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,630
but you're gonna notice
that since the scroll view

131
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:15,510
is clipping the content,

132
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:19,400
we have to make sure that the
content inside the scroll view

133
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,950
takes the full width.

134
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:23,770
And to solve that, we're
going to add a modifier

135
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:25,053
for V stack,

136
00:06:26,006 --> 00:06:28,940
.frame, parentheses

137
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:29,773
MaxWidth:

138
00:06:31,289 --> 00:06:33,180
.infinity

139
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,013
Awesome.

140
00:06:34,013 --> 00:06:37,500
Now we can see that both of
our screens are scrollable

141
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,360
and transitioning perfectly.

142
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,930
In the next session we're going to play

143
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:45,470
with an array of cards,
using a data model.

144
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:47,620
We're going to pass the data to each card

145
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,680
so that the content is unique.

146
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,490
And then we're going to match the cards

147
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:53,720
using matched symmetry effect.

148
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,209
So I'll see you in the next session.

149
00:06:56,209 --> 00:06:57,978
(outro beat)
