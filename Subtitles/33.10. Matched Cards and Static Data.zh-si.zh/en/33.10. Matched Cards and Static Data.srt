1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:03,457
(intense music)

2
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:16,230
- [Meng] Hi and welcome to
section 10 of my SwiftUI course.

3
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,820
So we're gonna start
working with static data,

4
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,310
meaning that our cards are
gonna look more interesting,

5
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:22,820
we're gonna have more cards,

6
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:26,180
and we're gonna make them work
with match geometry effect.

7
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:29,620
First of all, we're going to
create a new data model file.

8
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:30,883
So command N.

9
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,233
Select SwiftUI View.

10
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:36,270
We're gonna call this Course.

11
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,450
Make sure to target both macOS and iOS,

12
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:40,950
and that's because data should be

13
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:43,120
the same for all platforms.

14
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,980
To create our data model we
don't need the UI aspect.

15
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,410
We're gonna type struct,

16
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:50,243
Course

17
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:54,970
of type Identifiable, curly braces.

18
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:56,970
We're gonna start with a variable ID,

19
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:01,970
so var id is equal to
you UUID parentheses.

20
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:05,410
So this will auto generate a unique ID

21
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:07,440
for every single item

22
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,050
so that we can actually use
this for match geometry effect.

23
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:13,290
Each card is going to have a title.

24
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:16,670
So var title of type String.

25
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:21,010
Next var subtitle of type String as well,

26
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:23,970
var image of type String,

27
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:27,860
and then finally var color of type Color.

28
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:30,060
Now we're gonna need some sample data.

29
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:35,060
So var courses is equal to
array, so square brackets.

30
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:38,030
Let's put it in its own line,

31
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:42,760
and in the middle we're gonna
set Course, parentheses.

32
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,760
And so this is going to
detect the data model,

33
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,380
and we can select the one without the id

34
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:51,060
because the id is auto-generated.

35
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,990
So double click,

36
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:55,920
and now you can populate the
data based on the data type.

37
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,660
So String is quotes, the same for image.

38
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:03,910
As for the color, we're gonna use Color

39
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:06,310
parentheses color lit.

40
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:08,760
We're gonna use colorLiteral
in order to be able to

41
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:12,110
change the colors really easily.

42
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:14,810
So here I'm gonna paste a bunch of data

43
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:17,030
because it would be a lot of time

44
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:19,190
to type all of them manually.

45
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:21,900
So I'm just gonna paste the whole thing,

46
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:25,760
and feel free to use the text
content from this section,

47
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,450
or to use your own data,

48
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:30,520
as long as it respects the data model.

49
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,300
So you can see we have
a title for each card

50
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:38,060
and then the subtitle, the image
name, as well as the color.

51
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,743
Let's save this and head
back to CoursesView.

52
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:44,500
We have one card here and
then we have a second card,

53
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,070
which is entered manually.

54
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:48,203
The second card can be deleted.

55
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:52,790
And for the first card, we're
gonna command click on it

56
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:55,480
and then click on repeat.

57
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,780
So normally it just repeats
for a number of times.

58
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,970
It does not get any data.

59
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:03,480
Instead, we're gonna use the data model.

60
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,770
So from the sample data, courses,

61
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:10,890
which means this item is for each card.

62
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,120
So let's resume this.

63
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,180
Now you can see that we have a problem

64
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:19,370
because every single card is being matched

65
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:23,370
to the full screen because
all of them have the same ID.

66
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,810
So instead, we're going to replace

67
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:30,243
this ID that was entered
manually by item.id,

68
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:35,130
because in our data model, we
have the ID that is unique.

69
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:38,580
But the problem now is
how do we match this ID

70
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,240
to the full screen card?

71
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,830
Because if you click on it,

72
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:44,290
there is no shared element transition.

73
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,790
So for now, we're gonna do it manually,

74
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:49,960
meaning that instead of having this,

75
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,540
that does not match with the item.id

76
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:55,500
we're gonna get from the array courses,

77
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,160
and then using an index value,

78
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:01,100
we're going to pick the first card.

79
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:05,507
So square brackets,
zero, and at the end .id.

80
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,010
What this means is that
the full screen card

81
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:12,510
is going to be matched to the first card.

82
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:15,420
So only the first card
will be transitioning.

83
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:19,680
If I was to set, let's say
two, that means the third card,

84
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,030
then this card will be transitioning.

85
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,180
That's pretty cool.

86
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,580
So let's set it back to zero for now,

87
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:29,800
and let's pass the data to each card.

88
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,110
Let's command click on
CourseItem, jump to definition.

89
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:36,000
So we're gonna make sure that the data

90
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,630
in the CourseItem component
is going to be customizable.

91
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:42,080
So right before body,

92
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,040
we're gonna set a var
course of type Course,

93
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,610
which is the data model.

94
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:50,240
And we're gonna have some default value.

95
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,240
courses using the index value,
so square brackets, zero.

96
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:58,770
Now we're gonna replace
each hard-coded values

97
00:04:58,770 --> 00:04:59,610
by the data.

98
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:04,010
So course.image for the image.

99
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:08,550
And then for the first text
is going to be course.title.

100
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:12,728
The second text, course.subtitle.

101
00:05:12,728 --> 00:05:15,570
Then for the background, color.blue,

102
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:19,290
replace it with course.color.

103
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:20,400
And while we're here,

104
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,990
let's make the cornerRadius and the shadow

105
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,240
a little bit more interesting.

106
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,400
For cornerRadius I'm gonna
use the smooth corners

107
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,050
that you see a lot on iOS.

108
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:32,980
Let's select the whole .cornerRadius

109
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,713
and replace it with .clipShape.

110
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:41,200
Inside it RoundedRectangle, parentheses.

111
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,070
Select the first option.

112
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:45,500
It's gonna give you cornerRadius.

113
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:50,460
We're gonna set to 22,
and the style.continuous.

114
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,293
If you resume,

115
00:05:51,293 --> 00:05:52,750
you're gonna see that the data

116
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,180
has been replaced by your data.

117
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:59,260
And the cornerRadius is
now the smooth corners.

118
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,860
Finally, we're going to
customize our shadow.

119
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,370
So right before radius,

120
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:08,380
we're gonna set space and then set color,

121
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:11,940
colon, course.color.

122
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:16,520
And for that color, we're
gonna use .opacity parentheses.

123
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,353
Set it to 0.3.

124
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:22,620
After the parentheses, add a comma.

125
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,300
For the radius, I'm gonna set it to 20,

126
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:29,120
and then X position is going to be zero.

127
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,510
Y position is going to be 10.

128
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:35,250
Great, so now I have a
contextual drop shadow

129
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:40,250
that is using the background
color with a 30% opacity.

130
00:06:41,546 --> 00:06:43,550
Now I can go back to CoursesView,

131
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:46,630
and then I can pass to
the courseItem component.

132
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:51,630
So inside the parentheses course:item,

133
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:57,060
which is what I'm receiving
from this ForEach loop

134
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,790
using my array call courses.

135
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:01,453
As for the full screen,

136
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:05,707
inside the parentheses for CourseItem,

137
00:07:05,707 --> 00:07:09,920
course: courses, which is the array,

138
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,100
square brackets.

139
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,630
And I'm only targeting the first card.

140
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:18,430
So now you can see that the
data is being populated,

141
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:23,430
including the title, subtitle,
illustration, and colors.

142
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,100
And on top of that,

143
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,560
the transition will work.

144
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,540
If you change the index value,

145
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:33,410
so let's say three,
which is the fourth card.

146
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:36,590
So one, two, three, and four,

147
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:40,410
you click on it and it
has a beautiful transition

148
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:41,323
for that card.

149
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:45,093
Let's put it back to zero for now.

150
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:47,340
In the next session,

151
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:50,090
I wanna show you how to
set up a selection state,

152
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:54,040
which means that we will
be transitioning every card

153
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,810
to the full view card

154
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:58,040
without having to
manually select which one

155
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,660
we want to transition.

156
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,270
I think you're gonna find it interesting,

157
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:03,103
so I'll see you in the next session.
