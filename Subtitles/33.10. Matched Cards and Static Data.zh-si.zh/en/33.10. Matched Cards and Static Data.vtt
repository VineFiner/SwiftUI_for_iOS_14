00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.457
(intense music)

2
00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.230
<v Meng>Hi and welcome to section 10 of my SwiftUI course.</v>

3
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.820
So we're gonna start working with static data,

4
00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.310
meaning that our cards are gonna look more interesting,

5
00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:22.820
we're gonna have more cards,

6
00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.180
and we're gonna make them work with match geometry effect.

7
00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.620 line:15% 
First of all, we're going to create a new data model file.

8
00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:30.883 line:15% 
So command N.

9
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.233
Select SwiftUI View.

10
00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.270 line:15% 
We're gonna call this Course.

11
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.450 line:15% 
Make sure to target both macOS and iOS,

12
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.950 line:15% 
and that's because data should be

13
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.120 line:15% 
the same for all platforms.

14
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.980 line:15% 
To create our data model we don't need the UI aspect.

15
00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.410 line:15% 
We're gonna type struct,

16
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.243 line:15% 
Course

17
00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.970 line:15% 
of type Identifiable, curly braces.

18
00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:56.970 line:15% 
We're gonna start with a variable ID,

19
00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.970 line:15% 
so var id is equal to you UUID parentheses.

20
00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.410
So this will auto generate a unique ID

21
00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:07.440
for every single item

22
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.050
so that we can actually use this for match geometry effect.

23
00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.290 line:15% 
Each card is going to have a title.

24
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.670 line:15% 
So var title of type String.

25
00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.010 line:15% 
Next var subtitle of type String as well,

26
00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.970 line:15% 
var image of type String,

27
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.860 line:15% 
and then finally var color of type Color.

28
00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.060 line:15% 
Now we're gonna need some sample data.

29
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.060 line:15% 
So var courses is equal to array, so square brackets.

30
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.030 line:15% 
Let's put it in its own line,

31
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.760 line:15% 
and in the middle we're gonna set Course, parentheses.

32
00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.760
And so this is going to detect the data model,

33
00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.380
and we can select the one without the id

34
00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.060
because the id is auto-generated.

35
00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.990
So double click,

36
00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.920
and now you can populate the data based on the data type.

37
00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.660 line:15% 
So String is quotes, the same for image.

38
00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.910 line:15% 
As for the color, we're gonna use Color

39
00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.310 line:15% 
parentheses color lit.

40
00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.760 line:15% 
We're gonna use colorLiteral in order to be able to

41
00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:12.110
change the colors really easily.

42
00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.810
So here I'm gonna paste a bunch of data

43
00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.030
because it would be a lot of time

44
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.190 line:15% 
to type all of them manually.

45
00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.900 line:15% 
So I'm just gonna paste the whole thing,

46
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.760
and feel free to use the text content from this section,

47
00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.450
or to use your own data,

48
00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.520
as long as it respects the data model.

49
00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.300
So you can see we have a title for each card

50
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.060 line:15% 
and then the subtitle, the image name, as well as the color.

51
00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.743 line:15% 
Let's save this and head back to CoursesView.

52
00:02:42.083 --> 00:02:44.500 line:15% 
We have one card here and then we have a second card,

53
00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.070 line:15% 
which is entered manually.

54
00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.203 line:15% 
The second card can be deleted.

55
00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.790 line:15% 
And for the first card, we're gonna command click on it

56
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.480
and then click on repeat.

57
00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.780
So normally it just repeats for a number of times.

58
00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.970
It does not get any data.

59
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.480
Instead, we're gonna use the data model.

60
00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.770 line:15% 
So from the sample data, courses,

61
00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.890
which means this item is for each card.

62
00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.120
So let's resume this.

63
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.180
Now you can see that we have a problem

64
00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.370
because every single card is being matched

65
00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.370
to the full screen because all of them have the same ID.

66
00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.810 line:15% 
So instead, we're going to replace

67
00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.243 line:15% 
this ID that was entered manually by item.id,

68
00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.130
because in our data model, we have the ID that is unique.

69
00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.580
But the problem now is how do we match this ID

70
00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.240
to the full screen card?

71
00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.830
Because if you click on it,

72
00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.290
there is no shared element transition.

73
00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.790
So for now, we're gonna do it manually,

74
00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.960
meaning that instead of having this,

75
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.540
that does not match with the item.id

76
00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.500 line:15% 
we're gonna get from the array courses,

77
00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.160
and then using an index value,

78
00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.100 line:15% 
we're going to pick the first card.

79
00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.507 line:15% 
So square brackets, zero, and at the end .id.

80
00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.010
What this means is that the full screen card

81
00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.510
is going to be matched to the first card.

82
00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.420
So only the first card will be transitioning.

83
00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.680 line:15% 
If I was to set, let's say two, that means the third card,

84
00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.030
then this card will be transitioning.

85
00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:24.180
That's pretty cool.

86
00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.580 line:15% 
So let's set it back to zero for now,

87
00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.800 line:15% 
and let's pass the data to each card.

88
00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.110 line:15% 
Let's command click on CourseItem, jump to definition.

89
00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.000
So we're gonna make sure that the data

90
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.630
in the CourseItem component is going to be customizable.

91
00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.080 line:15% 
So right before body,

92
00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.040 line:15% 
we're gonna set a var course of type Course,

93
00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.610 line:15% 
which is the data model.

94
00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.240 line:15% 
And we're gonna have some default value.

95
00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:55.240 line:15% 
courses using the index value, so square brackets, zero.

96
00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.770 line:15% 
Now we're gonna replace each hard-coded values

97
00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:59.610 line:15% 
by the data.

98
00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:04.010 line:15% 
So course.image for the image.

99
00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:08.550 line:15% 
And then for the first text is going to be course.title.

100
00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:12.728 line:15% 
The second text, course.subtitle.

101
00:05:12.728 --> 00:05:15.570 line:15% 
Then for the background, color.blue,

102
00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.290 line:15% 
replace it with course.color.

103
00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:20.400
And while we're here,

104
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.990
let's make the cornerRadius and the shadow

105
00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:24.240
a little bit more interesting.

106
00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.400
For cornerRadius I'm gonna use the smooth corners

107
00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.050
that you see a lot on iOS.

108
00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:32.980 line:15% 
Let's select the whole .cornerRadius

109
00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:34.713 line:15% 
and replace it with .clipShape.

110
00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:41.200 line:15% 
Inside it RoundedRectangle, parentheses.

111
00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.070 line:15% 
Select the first option.

112
00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:45.500
It's gonna give you cornerRadius.

113
00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:50.460 line:15% 
We're gonna set to 22, and the style.continuous.

114
00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:51.293
If you resume,

115
00:05:51.293 --> 00:05:52.750
you're gonna see that the data

116
00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:55.180
has been replaced by your data.

117
00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:59.260
And the cornerRadius is now the smooth corners.

118
00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.860
Finally, we're going to customize our shadow.

119
00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.370
So right before radius,

120
00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:08.380 line:15% 
we're gonna set space and then set color,

121
00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:11.940 line:15% 
colon, course.color.

122
00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:16.520 line:15% 
And for that color, we're gonna use .opacity parentheses.

123
00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:17.353 line:15% 
Set it to 0.3.

124
00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:22.620 line:15% 
After the parentheses, add a comma.

125
00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.300 line:15% 
For the radius, I'm gonna set it to 20,

126
00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:29.120 line:15% 
and then X position is going to be zero.

127
00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.510 line:15% 
Y position is going to be 10.

128
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:35.250
Great, so now I have a contextual drop shadow

129
00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:40.250
that is using the background color with a 30% opacity.

130
00:06:41.546 --> 00:06:43.550
Now I can go back to CoursesView,

131
00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:46.630
and then I can pass to the courseItem component.

132
00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:51.630 line:15% 
So inside the parentheses course:item,

133
00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:57.060
which is what I'm receiving from this ForEach loop

134
00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:59.790
using my array call courses.

135
00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:01.453
As for the full screen,

136
00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:05.707 line:15% 
inside the parentheses for CourseItem,

137
00:07:05.707 --> 00:07:09.920 line:15% 
course: courses, which is the array,

138
00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.100 line:15% 
square brackets.

139
00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:14.630 line:15% 
And I'm only targeting the first card.

140
00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:18.430
So now you can see that the data is being populated,

141
00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:23.430
including the title, subtitle, illustration, and colors.

142
00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:25.100
And on top of that,

143
00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:27.560
the transition will work.

144
00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:29.540
If you change the index value,

145
00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:33.410
so let's say three, which is the fourth card.

146
00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:36.590
So one, two, three, and four,

147
00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:40.410
you click on it and it has a beautiful transition

148
00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:41.323
for that card.

149
00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:45.093
Let's put it back to zero for now.

150
00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:47.340
In the next session,

151
00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:50.090
I wanna show you how to set up a selection state,

152
00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:54.040
which means that we will be transitioning every card

153
00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:55.810
to the full view card

154
00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:58.040
without having to manually select which one

155
00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:59.660
we want to transition.

156
00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:01.270
I think you're gonna find it interesting,

157
00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:03.103
so I'll see you in the next session.
