00:00:00,889 --> 00:00:03,639
(theater sounds)

2
00:00:05,856 --> 00:00:08,439
(upbeat music)

3
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:14,830
[Instructor] Hello, welcome to session 11

4
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:16,510
of my SwiftUI course.

5
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:17,510
In this session,

6
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:20,470
we're going to learn how
to apply the transition

7
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:22,890
to every single card separately.

8
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,600
Before we start, I just wanna
organize my data model here.

9
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:30,080
Previously, we created
Course.swift for our data.

10
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,390
So we're gonna right click on that file,

11
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:35,309
and then New Group from Selection.

12
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:38,153
We're going to name this one Model.

13
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:43,510
I'm just gonna drag it
right after Navigation,

14
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:46,423
but make sure you're not
inside the Navigation.

15
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,851
After that, let's get back to CoursesView.

16
00:00:50,851 --> 00:00:53,620
So, what we wanna do
here for the full screen

17
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,810
is instead of using the Boolean show,

18
00:00:56,810 --> 00:01:00,980
we're just gonna check if
there's a selected item.

19
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:04,010
In order to do that, we're gonna
have to create a new state.

20
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:09,010
So, state var selected item,
which is of type course.

21
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:16,020
And by default, we wanna
set it to empty, so nil,

22
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,860
like this, if there is no item selected,

23
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:21,610
it's just not going to
show the full screen.

24
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:24,010
Now, Swift has something called optional,

25
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:26,640
and optional means that if it's possible

26
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,220
that there's no value,

27
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:32,220
then the data needs a question
mark to mean optional.

28
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,440
So thanks for that,

29
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,390
we're gonna be able to go
to the if show statement,

30
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,320
which is now using a Boolean.

31
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,920
And instead, we're gonna ask

32
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,920
if the selected item is not
nil, which means it's not empty.

33
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:49,080
So, we know that by default,
it's going to be empty,

34
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,700
which means that it's not
gonna show any full screen.

35
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,750
Right now it's not gonna do anything

36
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,580
because when we tap on a card,

37
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:59,990
it's only toggling the show state.

38
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:04,000
If we go to the tab
gesture at the very end,

39
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,860
you can see that we're
toggling the show state.

40
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,480
Now, in addition to doing that,

41
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:12,050
we should also change the selected item

42
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:13,580
to the one being tapped.

43
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,920
But right now because we
are not inside the loop,

44
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,540
we don't know which one is being tapped.

45
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:19,610
So, what we need to do here

46
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:23,420
is to get the onTapGesture modifier.

47
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:28,200
So, all of this modifier, cut,

48
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,600
and then put that to
the first course item,

49
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,460
right after frame.

50
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,800
Because of this, every single card

51
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,990
is going to have a tab gesture.

52
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:42,360
So now right after
show.toggle parentheses,

53
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:47,360
we're going to set selected
item is equal to item.

54
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:49,960
Item, meaning the specific data

55
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,800
that we're getting from the courses array.

56
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,060
Now for the selected item,

57
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:58,520
we're going to replace the
one being entered manually

58
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,967
by the value that we're getting

59
00:02:59,967 --> 00:03:02,040
from the selected item.

60
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,283
So, selected item,

61
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:05,740
and here we're getting an error

62
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:08,400
because the value that we need to pass

63
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,950
to the component cannot be empty.

64
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:13,490
So, we need to add an exclamation point

65
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:17,490
to mean that we know for
sure that selected item

66
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:19,370
is not gonna be empty, otherwise,

67
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:23,440
it wouldn't have passed this
condition in the first place.

68
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,790
And then we need to do the same

69
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:27,560
for the match symmetry effect ID.

70
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,900
So selected item, exclamation point.

71
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:31,733
And that's it.

72
00:03:31,733 --> 00:03:34,570
Now, we can tap on any of these cards

73
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:36,260
to go to full screen mode.

74
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:39,280
But now since we have only the tap gesture

75
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,890
for going to full screen,

76
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:44,000
we also need the tap
gesture for going back.

77
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,040
Otherwise, we won't be able
to tap back to the cards.

78
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,107
So, let's select this whole
modifier onTopGesture,

79
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:57,260
and then we're going to
Command + C to copy it.

80
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,660
Then we're gonna go to
the second course item,

81
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,110
right after to frame

82
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:03,880
and then paste that onTapGesture.

83
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:08,310
For the selected item, we
need to put it back to nil.

84
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:10,330
So, let's test our UI.

85
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:13,550
And here you can see
that it's working great.

86
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:16,600
The only issue with the
selected item technique

87
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,645
is that if you switch
between cards too fast,

88
00:04:19,645 --> 00:04:21,810
it's not gonna animate well.

89
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:24,360
And that's because the selected item

90
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,110
is changing before the animation is over.

91
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:32,030
So, while this selected item
technique is very clean,

92
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:36,350
we also need to make sure that
during the transition out,

93
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:38,560
we're not gonna be able
to select right away

94
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,920
to the next item before
we finish the animation.

95
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,360
For the transition in,

96
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,380
it's fine because it's still
focusing on a single card.

97
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:50,880
So, let's take care of the transition out.

98
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,310
So, we're gonna create a
new state at the top state.

99
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:58,617
State var, this is going to
be a Boolean, so isDisabled

100
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,440
is equal to false by default.

101
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,090
So, what we're going to do

102
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:05,870
is to disable the cards

103
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:09,490
while the transition out
animation is happening.

104
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:12,600
So let's click resume
after setting the state.

105
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,240
And then during the onTapGesture,

106
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,130
we're going to set isDisable to true,

107
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:21,570
meaning that we will be
able to disable the cards.

108
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:23,313
So, using this state,

109
00:05:23,313 --> 00:05:26,943
we can add a new modifier
for the course item,

110
00:05:26,943 --> 00:05:31,943
right after onTapGesture to disabled,

111
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:33,970
and this is a Boolean,

112
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:36,560
which means that we can use our state,

113
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,900
so isDisabled. Great.

114
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,710
So what should happen is
that when we tap on a card,

115
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:43,143
it's going to do the animation,

116
00:05:43,143 --> 00:05:45,820
and then we cannot have any more

117
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:49,200
because at this point,
everything has been disabled.

118
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,710
We just need to enable them
back at the right timing.

119
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:57,190
So, let's scroll down and
find the auto onTapGesture.

120
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:01,590
Here after selected item,
we're gonna set isDisable

121
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:03,840
is equal to false.

122
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,340
But you're gonna notice that
it's going to happen too fast,

123
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,840
and it's not going to solve our issue.

124
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,470
Now, what we can do is to add a delay.

125
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:16,470
So, let's set
dispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter.

126
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:22,300
And now we're going to set the timing,

127
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:27,300
which is dot now which
means now plus 0.3 second.

128
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,570
So, this code is a little bit complicated,

129
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:33,290
but it just means that
we're gonna wait 0.3 seconds

130
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:35,280
before running the code.

131
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,260
So, let's go to the next
value and press Enter.

132
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:43,510
And this is where we can put
isDisabled is equal to false.

133
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:47,044
So, let me cut that and
paste that right here.

134
00:06:47,044 --> 00:06:50,690
Now, what should happen
is that when I tap here,

135
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:52,580
the cards are disabled.

136
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,570
And when I tap back to the cards,

137
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:59,070
it's still going to be disabled,
but only for 0.3 second,

138
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:03,210
and again, this depends on
the timing of your animation.

139
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:06,360
For me, after a lot of
testing and clicking,

140
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,690
I noticed that 0.5 works best.

141
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:12,593
So, now we cannot break the UI anymore.

142
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:17,280
Alright, so that's what I
wanted to show you today.

143
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,160
In the next session,

144
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,320
we're going to look
into the new Lazy Grid.

145
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,810
We're gonna make our
layouts so much cooler,

146
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,430
and so much more adaptive

147
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:28,030
while still using the same transitions.

148
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,090
So I'm pretty excited

149
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:31,540
to show you Lazy Grid in the next session.

150
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:32,470
See you then.
