00:00:05.455 --> 00:00:10.455
(soft music)

2
00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:13.453
<v Meng>Hey there,</v>

3
00:00:13.453 --> 00:00:16.530
welcome to Section 13 of my Swift UI course.

4
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.760
So, having a lazyGrid layout,

5
00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.960
definitely introduce a bunch of issues such as;

6
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.010
the selected card being underneath the other cards

7
00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:26.400
during transition.

8
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.800
Another thing we want to do,

9
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.150
is to animate the whole container as it grows in size

10
00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.550
and show the content and go to full screen mode.

11
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.670
Right now, you can see that,

12
00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.023
the content is just appearing as a whole.

13
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.630
So this time we're gonna use

14
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.580
two matchedGeometryEffect IDs.

15
00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:46.413
First of all,

16
00:00:46.413 --> 00:00:49.840
we're going to need to set a container for the CourseItem.

17
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.510
So Command click on CourseItem

18
00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.280
and click on embed in VStack.

19
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.740
And for the VStack,

20
00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:01.740
we're going to copy the same matchGeometryEffect modifier,

21
00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.110
and paste it at the end of VStack.

22
00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:06.570
Now the difference is,

23
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.780
this container is going to have its own ID.

24
00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.920
Instead of using the item ID,

25
00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.480
we're going to add a unique name, including the item ID.

26
00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:21.480
So let's select item dot id and set double quotes,

27
00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.490
and then parentheses.

28
00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.170
And before the parentheses,

29
00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.900
we're going to do backward slash.

30
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.370
So this allows us to mix a string and a variable.

31
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.690
So right before the backward slash,

32
00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.290
we're going to type container.

33
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.600
So while keeping the item ID,

34
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.800
it's going to allow us to match

35
00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.320
with the full screen container.

36
00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.450
But, by adding this string,

37
00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.640
this can distinguish itself

38
00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.740
from the other matchedGeometryEffect ID.

39
00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.800
All right, so let's add a container

40
00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.940
to the full screen mode as well.

41
00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.200
I'm going to wrap that around the ScrollView.

42
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.500
So, Command click on ScrollView, embed in VStack.

43
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.960
This also means that all the modifiers for the ScrollView

44
00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.430
can be moved to the VStack.

45
00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.610
So the background, transition, and SafeArea modifiers,

46
00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.330
can be cut from the ScrollView

47
00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.490
and paste that for the VStack.

48
00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.770
Now make sure that you're putting it in the right place

49
00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.820
by double clicking on the curly braces

50
00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.853
to know where it ends.

51
00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.180
And once you have that,

52
00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.290
we can copy the matchedGeometryEffect modifier,

53
00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.563
and paste that right after dot background.

54
00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:41.540
Now we're going to do the same technique.

55
00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.583
So selecting selectedItem dot id,

56
00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.550
put quotes, parentheses, and before the parentheses,

57
00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.070
backward slash.

58
00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.300
Then we can type container before that.

59
00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.580
So what has been causing our card

60
00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.180
being below every other card, is in fact a transition.

61
00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.370
Since we're now animating the container,

62
00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.060
we don't need the delay transition anymore.

63
00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.190
So we can just remove the dot transition modifier.

64
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.680
So if you test this,

65
00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.030
you're gonna see a beautiful transition

66
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.230
of the content expanding, and then retracting.

67
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.810
The only issue is that when it retracts,

68
00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.970
then the content goes underneath.

69
00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.200
And that's not what we want.

70
00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.620
So to solve this,

71
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.820
we can add a zIndex

72
00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:33.560
for the ScrollView that is lower than for the full screen.

73
00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.100
So let's go to zIndex for the ScrollView,

74
00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.930
type dot zIndex and type one.

75
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.060
Then for the VStack for the full screen mode,

76
00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.420
we're going to set dot zIndex to two,

77
00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.750
right after the other modifiers.

78
00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.560
So now you're gonna see, when I transition out,

79
00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.200
then the content is still above the other cards.

80
00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.640
I can also add a cornerRadius for my content

81
00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.640
to fit more the cornerRadius of the cards.

82
00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.527
So right after background, I'm going to set dot clipShape.

83
00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.120
Then put rounded rectangle, parentheses,

84
00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.800
with cornerRadius of 22 and style continuous.

85
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.350
Now I have a really nice transition,

86
00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.430
and it works perfectly for all cards.

87
00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.020
By the way, you can play with the spring animation,

88
00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.130
by going to the first onTapGesture.

89
00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.640
And here, if you delete dot spring and type it again,

90
00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:42.060
you're gonna find auto-completion with more values.

91
00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.387
So we can set the response to 0.4 dampingFraction to 0.8,

92
00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.580
and blendDuration.

93
00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.170
We can set it to zero.

94
00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:55.470
Now you're gonna find that it's a little bit faster.

95
00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:00.470
So, you can set the response to be lower, to make it faster.

96
00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:02.210
And for the damping,

97
00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.490
if you set the number to be lower, such as 0.5,

98
00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.190
you're gonna see that it's going to bounce a lot more.

99
00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:12.130
You can definitely play with these values.

100
00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.633
For now, I'm just going to set response to 0.5.

101
00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.370
For the damping, I'm gonna set it to 0.7, all right?

102
00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:21.300
So this looks pretty good.

103
00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.190
What I need to do now is to add a closeButton

104
00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.550
instead of tapping on the card to close.

105
00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.290
Since we're going to reuse this closeButton a lot.

106
00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:31.470
I'm going to create a new Swift file,

107
00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:36.398
so command N, and then enter for SwiftUI View.

108
00:05:36.398 --> 00:05:40.960
closeButton, target iOS and Mac and then create.

109
00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.930
Let's resume this.

110
00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:47.930
And then we're going to replace the text with an image,

111
00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.080
parentheses, using system names.

112
00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:56.040
So SF symbols, quotes, "xmark".

113
00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:00.100
I'm going to set a custom size using the dot font

114
00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.210
dot system.

115
00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:07.000
And I'm gonna use size, weight, and design.

116
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.770
For the size, 17 weight dot bold.

117
00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:14.940
The design, I can just delete it because I don't need it.

118
00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.100
Next, we're going to set a background color.

119
00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:22.100
So background and then color dot black dot opacity,

120
00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.503
parentheses, 0.6.

121
00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:28.430
So let's make the icon to be white.

122
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:29.660
So before the background,

123
00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:34.020
we're going to put dot foregroundColor to be dot white.

124
00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.673
After that, we're gonna set dot padding,

125
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:40.993
dot all and set it to 10.

126
00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:43.240
One thing that I found useful

127
00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.930
is that you can select the image

128
00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:48.840
and you can see roughly what is the size of your element.

129
00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.480
And for the closeButton,

130
00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:54.600
I think between 32 and 36 is a pretty good size.

131
00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:57.960
Next, we're gonna use dot clipShape

132
00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.780
and make it into a circle, all right?

133
00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:03.800
So now that we have our closeButton component,

134
00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.930
we can go back to courses view,

135
00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:09.660
and we're going to implement it for the full screen.

136
00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:12.340
Let's Command click on the VStack,

137
00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:14.750
and embed in a VStack.

138
00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:18.000
And then we're going to change the VStack into a ZStack,

139
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.950
so that we can put the closeButton

140
00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:21.700
on top of the full screen.

141
00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:24.910
Now we have the VStack, which is the full screen card.

142
00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:27.590
And right after zIndex,

143
00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:32.590
we're going to use closeButton, parentheses.

144
00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:36.230
And then we're going to move the onTapGesture

145
00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:37.230
from the CourseItem.

146
00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:42.930
So select that modifier and paste that to our closeButton.

147
00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:43.763
Great.

148
00:07:43.763 --> 00:07:44.650
If we tap on a card,

149
00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:46.920
you're gonna see we have a zIndex problem.

150
00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:49.960
We're going to have to move the zIndex

151
00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.723
to the parent container which is now the ZStack.

152
00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:55.970
So, let's test the animation.

153
00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:58.010
It works perfectly,

154
00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:02.370
except that now the closeButton is kind of in the middle.

155
00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:05.670
So what you can do, with the ZStack here,

156
00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:09.020
is you can align elements inside the ZStack

157
00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:12.690
to be at any corner you want within that frame.

158
00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:16.610
So let's go to the ZStack, and put parentheses.

159
00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:21.343
Alignment, colon, dot topTrailing.

160
00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:23.950
Awesome.

161
00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:26.600
So now you can see the closeButton is at the top right.

162
00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.540
We can add a little bit of padding

163
00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:30.743
from the right of that closeButton.

164
00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:33.610
So, let's go to the closeButton,

165
00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:37.900
add dot padding, dot trailing,

166
00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:40.390
and we're gonna set it to 16.

167
00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:41.280
Perfect.

168
00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:43.940
Now you can see our beautiful animation

169
00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:45.980
that works on all cards.

170
00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:48.900
On top of that, it adapts to any layout that you want,

171
00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:50.610
using the lazyGrid.

172
00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:54.740
So, our courses view file is starting to get pretty heavy.

173
00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:58.210
And we should separate the full screen view

174
00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:00.220
to be in its own Swift file.

175
00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:02.940
Like this, it's easier to manage the data

176
00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:05.070
and reuse that view.

177
00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:08.230
But we will need to learn how to pass the nameSpace

178
00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:09.480
and the CourseData.

179
00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:10.690
So in the next session,

180
00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:12.960
we're going to learn how to manage that

181
00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:14.750
and make it all work.

182
00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:16.573
So I'll see you in the next session.
