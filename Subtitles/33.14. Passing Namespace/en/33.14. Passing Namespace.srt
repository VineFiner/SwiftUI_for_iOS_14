00:00:00,662 --> 00:00:04,245
(intense electronic music)

2
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:08,970
(lively electronic music)

3
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:16,600
- [Meng] Hi, welcome to section
14 of my SwiftUI course.

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,910
Today, we're gonna learn
how to pass the namespace

5
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:22,500
between views so that we can
have the full screen view

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,570
to be separate from the
CoursesView file, like this.

7
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:29,240
Is going to be easier to manage the data,

8
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,560
and we can reuse this view in isolation.

9
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,120
So, first of all, we're
going to create a new file,

10
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,890
so Command+N, select SwiftUI View.

11
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:40,907
Let's name it CourseDetail,

12
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:45,083
and we're going to target iOS and macOS.

13
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,130
Now, the first thing we're
gonna do is to go back

14
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:51,770
to CoursesView and
scroll down a little bit

15
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:54,860
to find which part that can be reused

16
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:56,800
as an isolated view.

17
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,080
So here, we have the card in full view,

18
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,800
and then we have the content,

19
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,320
we have the scroll view,

20
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:07,030
and then we have the
container with the background.

21
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:10,640
So, if we are to use
this view in isolation,

22
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,910
we don't really need the close button,

23
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:15,490
and also, you can see that it's attached

24
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:18,530
to the TapGesture, and some of the states

25
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:22,740
and animation that is very
specific to this transition,

26
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,290
but in term of the layout itself,

27
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:27,710
staring with the container
and the scroll view,

28
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:29,610
we can definitely reuse that.

29
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:32,500
So let's cut that, Command+X,

30
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:36,760
and replace that by
CourseDetail, parentheses.

31
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,050
Then I'm gonna go to CourseDetail,

32
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:42,880
and then replace the text
by that chunk of code.

33
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,570
Now, we're definitely going
to run into a bunch of issues

34
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:47,940
because we are missing variables.

35
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:51,630
So, for example, selectedItem
doesn't exist here,

36
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:53,870
the same for the namespace.

37
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:57,870
Now, what we need to do
is, from the CoursesView,

38
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:02,150
to pass the data to our
component called CourseDetail

39
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:06,060
in term of the course as
well as the namespace.

40
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,800
Going back to CourseDetail,

41
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,870
this is where we're going
to set those variables,

42
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:15,273
starting with var course of type Course,

43
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,020
and then we're gonna set the default,

44
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:21,080
so easy call to courses array,

45
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,140
and then we're gonna set
0 for the first item.

46
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,550
Next, we're going to need the namespace

47
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:30,100
in order to make our
matchedGeometryEffect still work.

48
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,840
So, right after Course,

49
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,840
we're going to declare var
namespace of type Namespace.ID.

50
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,040
Now, with these two variables,

51
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,510
we can set them at the correct places.

52
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:47,794
So, for example, course
is going to be course,

53
00:02:47,794 --> 00:02:52,650
matchedGeometryEffect id
is going to be course.id,

54
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:56,330
and the same for the second
matchedGeometryEffect,

55
00:02:56,330 --> 00:03:00,210
we're going to replace
selected item by course

56
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:02,630
without the exclamation point.

57
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,630
So this seems to work fine,

58
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:07,530
we're just missing some
values here for the preview

59
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:10,410
so that we can make it
work at the right side.

60
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:13,970
Now, because the course has a default,

61
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:16,810
you don't have to specify
that for the preview,

62
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:20,320
but the namespace, we will need a default.

63
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:24,520
So what we can do here is
to set a static variable

64
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,955
for the namespace, so let's type

65
00:03:26,955 --> 00:03:31,955
@Namespace static var namespace.

66
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,450
Then, inside the parentheses

67
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:39,180
of CourseDetail inside the preview,

68
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,643
we're going to put namespace: namespace.

69
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,150
Awesome.

70
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:48,940
Now, we just need to pass the namespace

71
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:51,590
from CoursesView as well.

72
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,870
So here, for CourseDetail,

73
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:58,870
we're going to pass
namespace: and then namespace.

74
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:04,160
For the CourseDetail, we
should also pass the course,

75
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:08,027
so before namespace, course:,

76
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:11,440
and then we're gonna
pass the selected item,

77
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:16,440
so selectedItem! and
don't forget the comma.

78
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,003
Now, with this, you can resume,

79
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:24,273
and everything should
be working like before.

80
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:29,930
And going back to CourseDetail,

81
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:32,240
the preview also works.

82
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,000
If you play this, you're gonna see

83
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,370
that the scrolling works,

84
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:39,900
and this is as if we
have an isolated view.

85
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,500
Now, while we're here,

86
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,170
we should import the rest
of the data for the app.

87
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:47,480
Let's go to Project files.

88
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,350
I'm going to open Model.

89
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:54,370
So far, we have already
created Course.swift.

90
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:56,700
Now, let's bring the rest of the data

91
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,730
so that we don't have
to manually create them,

92
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:03,210
and it's very repetitive,
so I created them for you.

93
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:06,410
I'm going to drag and drop these files

94
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,393
to the model folder.

95
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,710
Make sure to have these selected,

96
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:15,180
so Copy items if needed, Create groups,

97
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:20,180
and then iOS and macOS
targets, and then finish.

98
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:21,460
When you do that, you're gonna see

99
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:24,260
that we have a bunch
of new data model file,

100
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:27,200
including the one that
we have created earlier.

101
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,650
If you look at the content,

102
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:33,650
these are simple data model
with a bunch of sample data,

103
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:38,270
so the same for Download,
Livestream, Tutorial, et cetera.

104
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,830
So now, I can close this,

105
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:42,520
and go back to CourseDetail.

106
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,080
In CourseDetail, I'm going to resume,

107
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,570
and then, inside the ForEach loop,

108
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:48,880
we're going to replace

109
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,673
the manually-entered 20
items to courseSections,

110
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,460
and then I'm going to
customize the component

111
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:02,450
by Command clicking
it, Jump to Definition.

112
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:06,570
So, what we're going to do
is to replace these images,

113
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:09,560
text, and colors by the data.

114
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:14,440
So, first of all, we're going
to have to declare var item

115
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,800
of type CourseSection, and
we're gonna have a default

116
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,800
using courseSections, square brackets, 0.

117
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,310
So, if you look at the data
model for CourseSection,

118
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:32,150
you're gonna see that these
are the values that we have,

119
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:35,760
the title, subtitle, logo, and color,

120
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,070
and this is the sample data.

121
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:40,430
So let's click on this back arrow

122
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:42,160
to go to the previous file.

123
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,530
Otherwise, you can always open the folder

124
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:46,027
and go to CourseRow,

125
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,700
and then we're going to resume.

126
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,260
For the image, we're
going to use the logo,

127
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:55,140
and here, we're not
gonna use the SF symbols,

128
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:58,110
which means that we're
going to delete systemName.

129
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:02,390
We're just gonna put item.logo.

130
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:05,830
So now, we definitely have
a rendering mode problem.

131
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:09,060
Right now, it's using a
temp which is .template.

132
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:12,963
We're going to use the
original colors, so .original.

133
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,660
For the background view,

134
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:19,193
we're going to replace that by item.color.

135
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:23,803
Circle is great, and we
can delete foregroundColor

136
00:07:23,803 --> 00:07:25,690
because we don't need it anymore.

137
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:28,130
Next, let's replace the text.

138
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:30,330
So, for the first text,

139
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:33,540
we're going to use item.title.

140
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:38,330
For the second text,
let's use item.subtitle.

141
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:42,560
Awesome, now, we can put this
data inside CourseDetail.

142
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,690
So, right now, we have courseSections,

143
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:47,530
we have the correct numbers,

144
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:51,980
but we should pass the data
to my component CourseRow.

145
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:56,980
So, item: item, and
boom, we have our data.

146
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:02,830
Let's add a divider between those rows.

147
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:05,660
Let's type Divider, parentheses.

148
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:08,330
Awesome, we have a pretty cool UI now.

149
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:10,810
We can go back to courses view,

150
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:13,840
and then test the animation, and boom,

151
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,190
it still works perfectly.

152
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:18,710
So this is extremely flexible,

153
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:21,740
and we can replace with
real data later on.

154
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,100
So I hope you're having fun.

155
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,820
In the next session, I want to show you

156
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,910
how to create a background blur,

157
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,540
and we're going to adapt the UI

158
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:33,110
for iPad and macOS, as
well as the navigation,

159
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:35,853
