(intense electronic music)

2
00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:08.970
(lively electronic music)

3
00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.600
<v Meng>Hi, welcome to section 14 of my SwiftUI course.</v>

4
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.910
Today, we're gonna learn how to pass the namespace

5
00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.500
between views so that we can have the full screen view

6
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.570
to be separate from the CoursesView file, like this.

7
00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.240
Is going to be easier to manage the data,

8
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.560
and we can reuse this view in isolation.

9
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.120
So, first of all, we're going to create a new file,

10
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.890
so Command+N, select SwiftUI View.

11
00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.907
Let's name it CourseDetail,

12
00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.083
and we're going to target iOS and macOS.

13
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.130
Now, the first thing we're gonna do is to go back

14
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.770
to CoursesView and scroll down a little bit

15
00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.860
to find which part that can be reused

16
00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.800
as an isolated view.

17
00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.080
So here, we have the card in full view,

18
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.800
and then we have the content,

19
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.320
we have the scroll view,

20
00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.030
and then we have the container with the background.

21
00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.640
So, if we are to use this view in isolation,

22
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.910
we don't really need the close button,

23
00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.490
and also, you can see that it's attached

24
00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.530
to the TapGesture, and some of the states

25
00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.740
and animation that is very specific to this transition,

26
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.290
but in term of the layout itself,

27
00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.710
staring with the container and the scroll view,

28
00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.610
we can definitely reuse that.

29
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.500
So let's cut that, Command+X,

30
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.760
and replace that by CourseDetail, parentheses.

31
00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.050
Then I'm gonna go to CourseDetail,

32
00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.880
and then replace the text by that chunk of code.

33
00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.570
Now, we're definitely going to run into a bunch of issues

34
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.940
because we are missing variables.

35
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.630
So, for example, selectedItem doesn't exist here,

36
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.870
the same for the namespace.

37
00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.870
Now, what we need to do is, from the CoursesView,

38
00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:02.150
to pass the data to our component called CourseDetail

39
00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.060
in term of the course as well as the namespace.

40
00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.800
Going back to CourseDetail,

41
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.870
this is where we're going to set those variables,

42
00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:15.273
starting with var course of type Course,

43
00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.020
and then we're gonna set the default,

44
00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.080
so easy call to courses array,

45
00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.140
and then we're gonna set 0 for the first item.

46
00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.550
Next, we're going to need the namespace

47
00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.100
in order to make our matchedGeometryEffect still work.

48
00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.840
So, right after Course,

49
00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.840
we're going to declare var namespace of type Namespace.ID.

50
00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.040
Now, with these two variables,

51
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.510
we can set them at the correct places.

52
00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.794
So, for example, course is going to be course,

53
00:02:47.794 --> 00:02:52.650
matchedGeometryEffect id is going to be course.id,

54
00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.330
and the same for the second matchedGeometryEffect,

55
00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.210
we're going to replace selected item by course

56
00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.630
without the exclamation point.

57
00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.630
So this seems to work fine,

58
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.530
we're just missing some values here for the preview

59
00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.410
so that we can make it work at the right side.

60
00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.970
Now, because the course has a default,

61
00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.810
you don't have to specify that for the preview,

62
00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.320
but the namespace, we will need a default.

63
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.520
So what we can do here is to set a static variable

64
00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.955
for the namespace, so let's type

65
00:03:26.955 --> 00:03:31.955
@Namespace static var namespace.

66
00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.450
Then, inside the parentheses

67
00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.180
of CourseDetail inside the preview,

68
00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.643
we're going to put namespace: namespace.

69
00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.150
Awesome.

70
00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.940
Now, we just need to pass the namespace

71
00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.590
from CoursesView as well.

72
00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.870
So here, for CourseDetail,

73
00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.870
we're going to pass namespace: and then namespace.

74
00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:04.160
For the CourseDetail, we should also pass the course,

75
00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.027
so before namespace, course:,

76
00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.440
and then we're gonna pass the selected item,

77
00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.440
so selectedItem! and don't forget the comma.

78
00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.003
Now, with this, you can resume,

79
00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.273
and everything should be working like before.

80
00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.930
And going back to CourseDetail,

81
00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.240
the preview also works.

82
00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.000
If you play this, you're gonna see

83
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.370
that the scrolling works,

84
00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.900
and this is as if we have an isolated view.

85
00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.500
Now, while we're here,

86
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.170
we should import the rest of the data for the app.

87
00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:47.480
Let's go to Project files.

88
00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.350
I'm going to open Model.

89
00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:54.370
So far, we have already created Course.swift.

90
00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.700
Now, let's bring the rest of the data

91
00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.730
so that we don't have to manually create them,

92
00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:03.210
and it's very repetitive, so I created them for you.

93
00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.410
I'm going to drag and drop these files

94
00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.393
to the model folder.

95
00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:11.710
Make sure to have these selected,

96
00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.180
so Copy items if needed, Create groups,

97
00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:20.180
and then iOS and macOS targets, and then finish.

98
00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:21.460
When you do that, you're gonna see

99
00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.260
that we have a bunch of new data model file,

100
00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.200
including the one that we have created earlier.

101
00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.650
If you look at the content,

102
00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:33.650
these are simple data model with a bunch of sample data,

103
00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.270
so the same for Download, Livestream, Tutorial, et cetera.

104
00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:39.830
So now, I can close this,

105
00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:42.520
and go back to CourseDetail.

106
00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.080
In CourseDetail, I'm going to resume,

107
00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.570
and then, inside the ForEach loop,

108
00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:48.880
we're going to replace

109
00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:53.673
the manually-entered 20 items to courseSections,

110
00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.460
and then I'm going to customize the component

111
00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:02.450
by Command clicking it, Jump to Definition.

112
00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:06.570
So, what we're going to do is to replace these images,

113
00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:09.560
text, and colors by the data.

114
00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:14.440
So, first of all, we're going to have to declare var item

115
00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:18.800
of type CourseSection, and we're gonna have a default

116
00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:23.800
using courseSections, square brackets, 0.

117
00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.310
So, if you look at the data model for CourseSection,

118
00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:32.150
you're gonna see that these are the values that we have,

119
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:35.760
the title, subtitle, logo, and color,

120
00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.070
and this is the sample data.

121
00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:40.430
So let's click on this back arrow

122
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:42.160
to go to the previous file.

123
00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.530
Otherwise, you can always open the folder

124
00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:46.027
and go to CourseRow,

125
00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.700
and then we're going to resume.

126
00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:52.260
For the image, we're going to use the logo,

127
00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.140
and here, we're not gonna use the SF symbols,

128
00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:58.110
which means that we're going to delete systemName.

129
00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:02.390
We're just gonna put item.logo.

130
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:05.830
So now, we definitely have a rendering mode problem.

131
00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:09.060
Right now, it's using a temp which is .template.

132
00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:12.963
We're going to use the original colors, so .original.

133
00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:15.660
For the background view,

134
00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:19.193
we're going to replace that by item.color.

135
00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:23.803
Circle is great, and we can delete foregroundColor

136
00:07:23.803 --> 00:07:25.690
because we don't need it anymore.

137
00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:28.130
Next, let's replace the text.

138
00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:30.330
So, for the first text,

139
00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:33.540
we're going to use item.title.

140
00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:38.330
For the second text, let's use item.subtitle.

141
00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:42.560
Awesome, now, we can put this data inside CourseDetail.

142
00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:45.690
So, right now, we have courseSections,

143
00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:47.530
we have the correct numbers,

144
00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:51.980
but we should pass the data to my component CourseRow.

145
00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:56.980
So, item: item, and boom, we have our data.

146
00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:02.830
Let's add a divider between those rows.

147
00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:05.660
Let's type Divider, parentheses.

148
00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:08.330
Awesome, we have a pretty cool UI now.

149
00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:10.810
We can go back to courses view,

150
00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:13.840
and then test the animation, and boom,

151
00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:16.190
it still works perfectly.

152
00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:18.710
So this is extremely flexible,

153
00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:21.740
and we can replace with real data later on.

154
00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:23.100
So I hope you're having fun.

155
00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:24.820
In the next session, I want to show you

156
00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:26.910
how to create a background blur,

157
00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:28.540
and we're going to adapt the UI

158
00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:33.110
for iPad and macOS, as well as the navigation,

159
00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:35.853
so I'll see you in the next session.

160
00:08:35.853 --> 00:08:37.133
(piano note rings)
