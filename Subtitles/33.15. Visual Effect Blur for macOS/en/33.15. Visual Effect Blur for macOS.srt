00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:03,947
(ominous music)

2
00:00:06,283 --> 00:00:09,450
(upbeat techno music)

3
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:16,370
- [Meng] Hi, welcome to
Swift UI course, section 15.

4
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:19,800
Up until now, we have created
a really cool transition

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,680
between two screens.

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,460
All of this works great on a preview,

7
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:27,570
but when you run the app to iPhone 11,

8
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:32,570
as well as iPad pro 11 inch,
you'll notice that by default,

9
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:37,690
we have the navigation bar that
exists here without a title.

10
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:40,800
And that's why we have this big gap here.

11
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,670
On top of that, as a rule,

12
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:46,950
we should never have the
content bigger than 712,

13
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:50,650
which is the standard that
Apple has set for their model.

14
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:52,040
So what we can do here

15
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:56,910
is to set the max width of
our container to be 712,

16
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:00,020
and then add a background blur behind it.

17
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:03,200
To make the background blur
work for iOS and Mac iOS,

18
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,880
we're gonna need two files.

19
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,420
So let's go to project files.

20
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:11,360
And in the iOS folder, as
well as the macOS folder,

21
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,570
we have these files
that we have to import.

22
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:16,900
For iOS, we're gonna drag and drop

23
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:19,553
VisualEffectBlur to iOS.

24
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,953
Here, we're gonna check iOS.

25
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:27,690
Make sure to have copy items
if needed and create groups,

26
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:29,080
and then Finish.

27
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,690
Let's do the same for macOS.

28
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:34,560
So drag and drop VisualEffectBlur.swift

29
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,053
and drop it to macOS.

30
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:41,560
This time we're gonna
check target for macOS.

31
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,463
Again, copy items if
needed and create groups.

32
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:48,190
Now, the target is very important.

33
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:50,520
If you go to the inspector,

34
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,340
you will see here in the first tab,

35
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,620
which target this file is available to.

36
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:59,900
And notice that we have
the same name for the file,

37
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:04,900
but the content of the file
is different for Mac and iOS.

38
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:07,670
So when you build your
app for each platform,

39
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:10,690
the project will know
exactly which file to use

40
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:12,900
depending on the target.

41
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,990
Now, I do want to mention that this code

42
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:18,000
for VisualEffectBlur is made by Apple.

43
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,570
You can find the code in the Fruta app

44
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:21,780
that they have shared,

45
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:26,230
and also their license allows
for anyone to use their code.

46
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,750
So back to Xcode,

47
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:31,000
we're going to preview
on the iPad 11 inch.

48
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,310
You can see here that the
width of the container

49
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:38,040
is more than 712, so
we're gonna restrict that.

50
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,260
In CoursesView.swift,
we're gonna scroll down

51
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,140
and we're gonna find the z stack

52
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,650
for the full screen mode.

53
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:46,600
And right after zIndex,

54
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,973
we're going to put .frame,
parentheses, maxWidth: 712.

55
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,780
If you do that, you're gonna
see that your container

56
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:58,200
is now restricted to this width.

57
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,100
But what we would like to do
is to add another background

58
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:04,230
and using VisualEffectBlur this time.

59
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:06,520
First of all, we're gonna
create another frame.

60
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:10,973
So .frame, maxWidth: .infinity,

61
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,850
this will use all available space.

62
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:17,910
And afterwards we're gonna
add a background modifier.

63
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,383
So .background.

64
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:23,283
And now we can use VisualEffectBlur.

65
00:03:23,283 --> 00:03:27,130
So, VisualEffectBlur, parentheses.

66
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:27,990
And that's it.

67
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:32,090
Now you can test and you can
see that we have just added

68
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:34,100
a background blur.

69
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,800
If you want to fill the whole screen,

70
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,360
including the safe area,

71
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,237
we can just add after the parentheses,

72
00:03:40,237 --> 00:03:44,860
.edgesIgnoringSafeArea to all.

73
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:47,363
So this will fill the safe area as well.

74
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:51,650
Now, please note that you
can customize the style

75
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:56,650
of the blur, but that customization
will only work for iOS.

76
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:59,210
So if you want to customize
the VisualEffectBlur,

77
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:01,630
as well as the navigation bar,

78
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:04,260
we'll need to set up
the platform conditions.

79
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:08,130
And we will also need to
organize our file here.

80
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:10,660
So let's set mini components.

81
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:15,210
Here, right before the last curly brace,

82
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:20,210
I'm gonna add var fullContent
of type some View.

83
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:27,990
Then I'm gonna cut everything
from the if selectedItem

84
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:29,430
and its content.

85
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,290
So double click on this,

86
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:35,010
you're gonna find that this is the code.

87
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:37,783
And I'm gonna paste it inside fullContent.

88
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:41,773
For fullContent, we'll
need to set ViewBuilder.

89
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:45,540
Next, let's do the same for content.

90
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:48,320
So right before fullContent,

91
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:53,320
let's set var content of
type some View, curly braces.

92
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,710
Then I'm gonna scroll up a little bit

93
00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:00,390
to find the ScrollView and the content,

94
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:02,393
plus the zIndex modifier.

95
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,763
Select all of this, cut.

96
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:08,973
Paste to content.

97
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,780
And then we can reference
them from the body

98
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,230
inside the z stack.

99
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:18,970
So content, and then after
content, fullContent.

100
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:22,430
Now we can scroll down to
find the background modifier

101
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:26,560
that has the VisualEffectBlur, cut it.

102
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,313
And we're gonna paste that
right after full content.

103
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:33,420
So now let's set a platform condition.

104
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:37,383
Right before content, pound if os, iOS.

105
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:43,670
And then after fullContent, pound, else.

106
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:45,367
And then after that, endif.

107
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:50,290
Now we can copy content and fullContent,

108
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:52,520
including the background modifier.

109
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:57,520
And this is where we can
customize the blur style for iOS.

110
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,470
So for blur style, you can set blur style.

111
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:05,570
And for the value, we
have a bunch of options.

112
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:07,960
But the auto-completion
might not work correctly

113
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,080
at this point.

114
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,313
So what we can do is to Command
+ click on VisualEffectBlur,

115
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:17,930
jump to definition, this
will open the Swift file.

116
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:20,900
And you'll find that
we have a default style

117
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,090
that is system material.

118
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:25,380
So that's the standard blur strength,

119
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:28,270
and it also adapts to
dark mode automatically.

120
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:30,650
You can also check the other options

121
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:35,630
by selecting systemMaterial,
deleting it, press dot again,

122
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:38,170
and this is where you're
gonna find a bunch of options.

123
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:42,230
So we have dark, extra light,
light, prominent, et cetera.

124
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:44,490
Now, if you use the system ones,

125
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:47,970
they will adapt to dark
mode and light mode.

126
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:51,980
Just to give you an idea, we
have systemChrome, Material,

127
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:55,320
Thick, Thin, and UltraThin.

128
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:59,260
So, the thicker it is,
the easier it is to read

129
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,190
and see the content.

130
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,470
And the thinner it is,

131
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:04,690
the more you're gonna see the background.

132
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,340
Now we're not gonna change anything here,

133
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:08,290
so I'm just gonna put back systemMaterial,

134
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:10,870
but I just wanted to show you the options,

135
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:14,570
since here the auto-completion
might not work correctly.

136
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:16,370
But otherwise, if it works,

137
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:20,140
you're gonna be able to change
to any of these options.

138
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:23,980
For example, let's try
ultra thin material.

139
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:26,670
And here are you gonna
see that the background

140
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:28,520
is a lot more visible.

141
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,453
If you set it to systemThickMaterial,

142
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:37,723
you will see that the
background is barely visible.

143
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,770
The blur style is only available on iOS.

144
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:46,260
So that's why we have to keep using

145
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,203
just the parentheses for Mac.

146
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:51,653
Let me set back to systemMaterial.

147
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:55,600
And now we're gonna deal
with the navigation bar.

148
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,870
First of all, you can set a title.

149
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:02,870
Right after the z stack, let's
set .navigation bar Title,

150
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,920
set that to Courses.

151
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,550
So if you run the app,
it's gonna look like this.

152
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:11,160
The problem is the navigation
bar will be on top.

153
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,020
Just like if we had a tab bar,

154
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:15,530
it will also be on top of the content.

155
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:17,850
And that might not be ideal.

156
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:21,200
What we can do here is to
hide the navigation bar,

157
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,540
but this will only work for iOS.

158
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:26,933
So we're gonna have to do
it for the content for iOS.

159
00:08:27,778 --> 00:08:32,778
.navigationBarHidden, set it to true.

160
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:36,400
By doing this, we solve our
problem with the spacing

161
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,570
for the Close button,

162
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:41,423
but also the title of the
nav bar that was on top.

163
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:44,683
Now let's run this for the Mac.

164
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,500
On a Mac, you can see that
everything works perfectly,

165
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,210
including the background blur,

166
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:53,840
the max width of the container
and even the animation.

167
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,490
But we do have a problem with a safe area,

168
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:57,810
which we can disable.

169
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:00,560
To do that, we're gonna
go to course detail.

170
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,370
And this is where we're gonna
organize in the same way.

171
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:09,370
So let's create var content of
type some View, curly braces,

172
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,830
cut and paste the VStack,

173
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:18,830
including everything except
the safe area modifier.

174
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:21,600
So let me paste this to content

175
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,300
and referencing this from the body.

176
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,650
After that, we can set
the platform condition

177
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:31,650
using pound, if os iOS,
pound else, pound endiff.

178
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:38,960
For Mac, we're gonna set just content.

179
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,330
So this solves our
problem with the nav bar

180
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,770
hiding part of the card,

181
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:47,600
but now we have some spacing
issue with the close button.

182
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,150
But also, we want to make
sure that the rounded corners

183
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:53,690
make sense for the Mac as well.

184
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:57,350
So on the Mac, the corner
radius needs to fit

185
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:59,400
with the corner radius of the window.

186
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,750
So this needs to be
about 10 instead of 22.

187
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:05,030
First of all, let's fix the corner radius.

188
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,690
Let's go to courses view.

189
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,793
We're gonna find the Close button,

190
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,930
right here for the fullContent.

191
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:13,300
And for the padding,

192
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,580
instead of just setting for the trailing,

193
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,810
we're gonna remove trailing

194
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:20,970
and just put 16 inside a parentheses.

195
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:22,460
Now for the corner radius,

196
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:25,773
we're gonna go to the folder
call Items, CourseItem.

197
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:29,210
Then right after var course,

198
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:34,123
we're gonna set pound if os, iOS,

199
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:40,040
var cornerRadius of type
CGFloat is equal to 22.

200
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:47,373
After that, pound else, pound endif.

201
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:52,570
Let's copy var cornerRadius.

202
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:55,790
And for the Mac, we're gonna set it to 10.

203
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,300
Then using this value,

204
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:01,850
we're gonna replace 22
here for the clip shape.

205
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:04,800
So let's put corner radius.

206
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,100
That's much better.

207
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,760
Now what we should do is to
deal with the corner radius

208
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,440
of the container.

209
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,370
Let's copy this code for
the platform condition,

210
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:15,260
including the corner radius,

211
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:17,680
let's go to CourseDetail,

212
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,210
and right after namespace, paste that.

213
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:25,350
This time for the Mac,
I'm gonna set it to zero.

214
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:27,790
And then using the corner radius value,

215
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:30,703
I'm going to replace the
corner radius for clipShape.

216
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:32,843
So cornerRadius.

217
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,690
That's much better.

218
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:39,140
We can also remove the corner radius

219
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,920
when it is in full screen.

220
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,610
So in CourseDetail, for CourseItem,

221
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:49,610
we're gonna add comma,
cornerRadius, set it to zero.

222
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:52,540
So now, testing on all platforms,

223
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:55,350
you can see that it looks really good.

224
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:58,810
The same for the iPad and for the iPhone.

225
00:11:58,810 --> 00:11:59,680
In the next session,

226
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,560
I want to show you how to use size class

227
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:05,390
to detect between a big
screen like the iPad,

228
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:07,760
and a smaller screen like the iPhone,

229
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,750
so that we can use a tab bar instead.

230
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,673
So I'll see you in the next session.
