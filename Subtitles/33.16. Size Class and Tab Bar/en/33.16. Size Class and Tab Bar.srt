(eerie music)

2
00:00:05,574 --> 00:00:08,157
(upbeat music)

3
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:14,950
- [Meng] Hello there,
welcome to section 16

4
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:16,690
of my SwiftUI course.

5
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:19,080
Today we'll learn how
to detect the size class

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,170
so that we can use a sidebar for the iPad

7
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,260
and the tab bar for the iPhone.

8
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:26,740
If you're not aware of
what the size class is

9
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:30,070
you can go to the human
interface guidelines by Apple

10
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:33,300
to visual design, adaptivity and layout

11
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,250
and here you will find which device

12
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:39,360
in portrait or landscape mode
goes to which size class,

13
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,750
it is most common to detect
the width size class,

14
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,480
and there are two of them.

15
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,110
First, the regular second the compact.

16
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:51,680
Now every iPad either in landscape

17
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,930
or portrait mode will be regular
for both width and height.

18
00:00:55,930 --> 00:01:00,600
Every iPhone in portrait mode
will be compact for width.

19
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,500
And regular for height.

20
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,050
But in landscape mode,

21
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:06,880
it's compact for both width and height.

22
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,880
The only exception where in
landscape the width is regular

23
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:15,300
is for the iPhone in max plus

24
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,770
or XR resolutions.

25
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:19,530
But if we focus on the width,

26
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:22,930
you're gonna find that
the iPad will be regular,

27
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:25,400
and the iPhone will be compact,

28
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:29,000
except when you use the
iPhone in landscape mode,

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,590
but only for the larger iPhones.

30
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,080
So back to our code,

31
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:36,580
we're gonna go to navigation content view.

32
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:40,320
Now notice that in iOS
for both iPhone and iPad,

33
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,350
we're just using the sidebar.

34
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:46,130
What we like to do is for
the compact size class

35
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:48,270
to use a tab bar instead.

36
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,920
In order to do that, we're
going to have to declare

37
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,480
an environment variable.

38
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:57,480
So let's set commercially
environment parentheses,

39
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:00,760
backward slash dot horizontal

40
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,810
size class

41
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:07,030
var horizontal

42
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:08,103
size class.

43
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:12,600
Now size class will only work for iOS.

44
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,920
So we're gonna have to make sure that

45
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,010
we don't run this code on a Mac.

46
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:20,600
So let's set the
condition, pound if OS, iOS

47
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,080
and then pound end if.

48
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,300
Then in the body,

49
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:30,410
we're gonna set a condition
if horizontal size class

50
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:34,050
equal equal dot compact,

51
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:36,640
curly braces will include the tab bar,

52
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,410
which we haven't created yet.

53
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:42,293
And then else will include the sidebar.

54
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,650
Next, let's go ahead
and create that top bar.

55
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:49,490
So Command N swift UI view

56
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:53,520
tab bar.

57
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,120
And here, we're going to include that

58
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,370
only for iOS

59
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:02,410
to create a task bar, it's fairly simple.

60
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:04,810
First, we're going to replace the text

61
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:07,760
by tab, view,

62
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,110
curly braces.

63
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:11,420
Then you can see the tab bar here,

64
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:14,940
we're just gonna add
each tab for each view.

65
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,830
So in this case, we're gonna
start with the courses view

66
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:19,583
parentheses,

67
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:24,453
then use the modifier dot tap item.

68
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:28,010
And then for the content,
we can set an icon.

69
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:32,440
Let's type image parentheses system name.

70
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,560
And then the name of the SS symbol,

71
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,870
it's going to be book dot closed.

72
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:38,880
For the text,

73
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,880
it automatically detects
the navigation title.

74
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,460
But otherwise, if you wanna custom text,

75
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:48,040
then we can add a text.

76
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,960
So text parentheses, courses.

77
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:55,000
Now we don't have a
navigation view because

78
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,500
this was set in the sidebar.

79
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,590
So we're gonna have to
set it here as well.

80
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,520
We'll have to wrap the courses view

81
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,680
inside a navigation view.

82
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,423
So navigation view,

83
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,940
curly braces,

84
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:11,260
and I will put courses view inside it.

85
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:15,330
So now the modifier is to
navigation view instead

86
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:16,950
of the courses view.

87
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,840
Now you don't see the navigation view here

88
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,540
because we set it to hidden.

89
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,830
But we can reuse this code,

90
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,170
including the navigation view

91
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:28,633
and the tab item modifier
for the other tabs.

92
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:30,970
For the second one,

93
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:34,240
we're gonna use let's say course list,

94
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,160
set the icon to list.bullet.rectangle.

95
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:42,530
And we're gonna name this one, tutorials.

96
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:45,130
So if you play the preview,

97
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:47,470
and you tap on the second tab,

98
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:50,350
it's going to show you
the course list view.

99
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:53,360
And this time since the
navbar is not set to hidden,

100
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,520
you see it

101
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:58,300
so now I'm just gonna repeat
this code and add more tabs.

102
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,740
Feel free to copy and paste
the code from the text content,

103
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:05,780
so we have TV for live streams,

104
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:08,300
mailed out stack for certificates,

105
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,860
magnifying glass for search.

106
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,370
All of the tabs are using the course list

107
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:16,530
as a placeholder until
we have those screens.

108
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:20,180
All right, since we're not
using a navigation bar,

109
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,780
in the courses view,

110
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,110
we're gonna have to add
a custom large title,

111
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:27,890
and then we can add
more content underneath.

112
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:30,010
Let's go to courses view.

113
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:32,090
Let's scroll down a little bit

114
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:34,190
to find the content,

115
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:37,880
then the scroll view and
before the lazy v grid,

116
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,780
we're going to set text

117
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,520
courses.

118
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:46,813
Then set a font modifier .large title,

119
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:50,130
then .bold.

120
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:53,050
Then instead of using
an h tag with a spacer,

121
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:56,500
we can also use a technique .frame

122
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,550
with a max width

123
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:02,170
to .infinity

124
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:04,580
and comma alignment

125
00:06:05,873 --> 00:06:07,393
.leading,

126
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,760
we should add some padding.

127
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,367
So,

128
00:06:11,367 --> 00:06:12,200
.padding

129
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:14,740
16.

130
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,320
Then just like the large title,

131
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,890
we have a bit more padding from the top.

132
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:20,223
So,

133
00:06:20,223 --> 00:06:21,370
.padding

134
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:24,530
parentheses .top

135
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:25,860
54.

136
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,980
Now we have an issue with a spacing

137
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:31,900
between the large title and the items.

138
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:36,010
So to fix this, we're going
to have to wrap the content

139
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:37,050
inside a v stack.

140
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:41,020
So Command click on the
text embedded v stack.

141
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:43,700
And we'll have to put
the lazy grid as well

142
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,630
including its modifiers

143
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,163
inside that v stack.

144
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,410
For the v stack,

145
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:59,453
we're going to set
parentheses spacing to zero.

146
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:02,890
So this solves our padding issue.

147
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:05,730
Now the padding here is for all sides,

148
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:08,083
we can specify to just leading.

149
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:13,230
Perfect now we can add
some content underneath

150
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:14,563
this grid of items.

151
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:19,340
Let's start with course row, parentheses.

152
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,280
Then we're going to loop it.

153
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,023
So Command click, select repeat.

154
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:28,363
Then we'll set the array
to course sections,

155
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,360
and then pass the item.

156
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,333
So item,

157
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:34,600
item.

158
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,820
Now if we scroll down, you
can see a list of course row

159
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,550
if you test on the iPad,

160
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:44,010
so we're gonna select the iPad 11 inch,

161
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:47,730
we can definitely use grid
to have multiple columns

162
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:49,530
of those lists items.

163
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:53,860
Let's Command click on
for each embedded v stack.

164
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,330
Replace v stack

165
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:57,070
by lazy

166
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:57,903
v grid

167
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,720
parentheses columns

168
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,710
colon, square brackets,

169
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:06,960
grid item

170
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,893
parentheses,

171
00:08:08,984 --> 00:08:12,230
.adaptive parenthesis,

172
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:13,063
minimum

173
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,860
to 240.

174
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,850
Great this looks much better

175
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:21,460
and we have a better use of
the space available to us.

176
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,910
Let's add a little bit of padding.

177
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:25,050
So .padding parethesis.

178
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:28,630
Then we can add a title for this list.

179
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:30,970
So right before the lazy grid,

180
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:35,833
we're gonna set text
parentheses latest sections.

181
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:41,800
Then we're gonna set dot
font weight to semi bold.

182
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,647
Let's also add

183
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:44,907
.frame, parenthesis,

184
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:49,080
max width .infinity,

185
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,753
comma, alignment .leading.

186
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:57,970
And after the frame, we're
gonna set .padding parentheses.

187
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:01,090
Now let's not forget to
go back to content view.

188
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:03,950
And for the size class compact,

189
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:07,180
we're going to set tab bar parenthesis.

190
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,890
So if you run your app
on all three platforms,

191
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:13,730
you can see that the title
here is roughly aligned

192
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:16,170
to the learn on the left side.

193
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:19,393
And the iPhone has the tab bar.

194
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:23,580
And the Mac is using the sidebar as well

195
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:26,050
with the extra content that we just added.

196
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:26,950
In the next session,

197
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:30,130
I wanna show you how to set
two types of navigation.

198
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:32,680
One is using the navigation link,

199
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,430
and the second one is to use the modal.

200
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:37,313
So I'll see you in the next session.
