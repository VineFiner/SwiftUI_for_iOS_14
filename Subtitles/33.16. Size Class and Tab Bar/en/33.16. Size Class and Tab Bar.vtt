00:00:00.715 --> 00:00:03.215
(eerie music)

2
00:00:05.574 --> 00:00:08.157
(upbeat music)

3
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.950
<v Meng>Hello there, welcome to section 16</v>

4
00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:16.690
of my SwiftUI course.

5
00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.080
Today we'll learn how to detect the size class

6
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.170
so that we can use a sidebar for the iPad

7
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.260
and the tab bar for the iPhone.

8
00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.740
If you're not aware of what the size class is

9
00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.070
you can go to the human interface guidelines by Apple

10
00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.300
to visual design, adaptivity and layout

11
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.250
and here you will find which device

12
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.360
in portrait or landscape mode goes to which size class,

13
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.750
it is most common to detect the width size class,

14
00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.480
and there are two of them.

15
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.110
First, the regular second the compact.

16
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.680
Now every iPad either in landscape

17
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.930
or portrait mode will be regular for both width and height.

18
00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.600
Every iPhone in portrait mode will be compact for width.

19
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.500
And regular for height.

20
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.050
But in landscape mode,

21
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.880
it's compact for both width and height.

22
00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.880
The only exception where in landscape the width is regular

23
00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.300
is for the iPhone in max plus

24
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.770
or XR resolutions.

25
00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.530
But if we focus on the width,

26
00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.930
you're gonna find that the iPad will be regular,

27
00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.400
and the iPhone will be compact,

28
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.000
except when you use the iPhone in landscape mode,

29
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.590
but only for the larger iPhones.

30
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.080
So back to our code,

31
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.580
we're gonna go to navigation content view.

32
00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.320
Now notice that in iOS for both iPhone and iPad,

33
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.350
we're just using the sidebar.

34
00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.130
What we like to do is for the compact size class

35
00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.270
to use a tab bar instead.

36
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.920
In order to do that, we're going to have to declare

37
00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.480
an environment variable.

38
00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.480
So let's set commercially environment parentheses,

39
00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.760
backward slash dot horizontal

40
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.810
size class

41
00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.030
var horizontal

42
00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.103
size class.

43
00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.600
Now size class will only work for iOS.

44
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.920
So we're gonna have to make sure that

45
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.010
we don't run this code on a Mac.

46
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.600
So let's set the condition, pound if OS, iOS

47
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.080
and then pound end if.

48
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.300
Then in the body,

49
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.410
we're gonna set a condition if horizontal size class

50
00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.050
equal equal dot compact,

51
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.640
curly braces will include the tab bar,

52
00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.410
which we haven't created yet.

53
00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.293
And then else will include the sidebar.

54
00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.650
Next, let's go ahead and create that top bar.

55
00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.490
So Command N swift UI view

56
00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.520
tab bar.

57
00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.120
And here, we're going to include that

58
00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.370
only for iOS

59
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.410
to create a task bar, it's fairly simple.

60
00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.810
First, we're going to replace the text

61
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.760
by tab, view,

62
00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.110
curly braces.

63
00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.420
Then you can see the tab bar here,

64
00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.940
we're just gonna add each tab for each view.

65
00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.830
So in this case, we're gonna start with the courses view

66
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:19.583
parentheses,

67
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.453
then use the modifier dot tap item.

68
00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.010
And then for the content, we can set an icon.

69
00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.440
Let's type image parentheses system name.

70
00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.560
And then the name of the SS symbol,

71
00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.870
it's going to be book dot closed.

72
00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:38.880
For the text,

73
00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.880
it automatically detects the navigation title.

74
00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.460
But otherwise, if you wanna custom text,

75
00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:48.040
then we can add a text.

76
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.960
So text parentheses, courses.

77
00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.000
Now we don't have a navigation view because

78
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.500
this was set in the sidebar.

79
00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.590
So we're gonna have to set it here as well.

80
00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.520
We'll have to wrap the courses view

81
00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.680
inside a navigation view.

82
00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.423
So navigation view,

83
00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:07.940
curly braces,

84
00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.260
and I will put courses view inside it.

85
00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.330
So now the modifier is to navigation view instead

86
00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:16.950
of the courses view.

87
00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.840
Now you don't see the navigation view here

88
00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.540
because we set it to hidden.

89
00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.830
But we can reuse this code,

90
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.170
including the navigation view

91
00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:28.633
and the tab item modifier for the other tabs.

92
00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:30.970
For the second one,

93
00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.240
we're gonna use let's say course list,

94
00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.160
set the icon to list.bullet.rectangle.

95
00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.530
And we're gonna name this one, tutorials.

96
00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.130
So if you play the preview,

97
00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.470
and you tap on the second tab,

98
00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.350
it's going to show you the course list view.

99
00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:53.360
And this time since the navbar is not set to hidden,

100
00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.520
you see it

101
00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.300
so now I'm just gonna repeat this code and add more tabs.

102
00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.740
Feel free to copy and paste the code from the text content,

103
00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.780
so we have TV for live streams,

104
00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.300
mailed out stack for certificates,

105
00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.860
magnifying glass for search.

106
00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.370
All of the tabs are using the course list

107
00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.530
as a placeholder until we have those screens.

108
00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:20.180
All right, since we're not using a navigation bar,

109
00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:21.780
in the courses view,

110
00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:25.110
we're gonna have to add a custom large title,

111
00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.890
and then we can add more content underneath.

112
00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:30.010
Let's go to courses view.

113
00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:32.090
Let's scroll down a little bit

114
00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:34.190
to find the content,

115
00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:37.880
then the scroll view and before the lazy v grid,

116
00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.780
we're going to set text

117
00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.520
courses.

118
00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.813
Then set a font modifier .large title,

119
00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.130
then .bold.

120
00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:53.050
Then instead of using an h tag with a spacer,

121
00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:56.500
we can also use a technique .frame

122
00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.550
with a max width

123
00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:02.170
to .infinity

124
00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:04.580
and comma alignment

125
00:06:05.873 --> 00:06:07.393
.leading,

126
00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:09.760
we should add some padding.

127
00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.367
So,

128
00:06:11.367 --> 00:06:12.200
.padding

129
00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:14.740
16.

130
00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:16.320
Then just like the large title,

131
00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.890
we have a bit more padding from the top.

132
00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:20.223
So,

133
00:06:20.223 --> 00:06:21.370
.padding

134
00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:24.530
parentheses .top

135
00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:25.860
54.

136
00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:27.980
Now we have an issue with a spacing

137
00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:31.900
between the large title and the items.

138
00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:36.010
So to fix this, we're going to have to wrap the content

139
00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:37.050
inside a v stack.

140
00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:41.020
So Command click on the text embedded v stack.

141
00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:43.700
And we'll have to put the lazy grid as well

142
00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:45.630
including its modifiers

143
00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:49.163
inside that v stack.

144
00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:55.410
For the v stack,

145
00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:59.453
we're going to set parentheses spacing to zero.

146
00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:02.890
So this solves our padding issue.

147
00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:05.730
Now the padding here is for all sides,

148
00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:08.083
we can specify to just leading.

149
00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:13.230
Perfect now we can add some content underneath

150
00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:14.563
this grid of items.

151
00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:19.340
Let's start with course row, parentheses.

152
00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:21.280
Then we're going to loop it.

153
00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:24.023
So Command click, select repeat.

154
00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:28.363
Then we'll set the array to course sections,

155
00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:31.360
and then pass the item.

156
00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:32.333
So item,

157
00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:34.600
item.

158
00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:38.820
Now if we scroll down, you can see a list of course row

159
00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:40.550
if you test on the iPad,

160
00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:44.010
so we're gonna select the iPad 11 inch,

161
00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:47.730
we can definitely use grid to have multiple columns

162
00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:49.530
of those lists items.

163
00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:53.860
Let's Command click on for each embedded v stack.

164
00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:55.330
Replace v stack

165
00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:57.070
by lazy

166
00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:57.903
v grid

167
00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.720
parentheses columns

168
00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:04.710
colon, square brackets,

169
00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:06.960
grid item

170
00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:07.893
parentheses,

171
00:08:08.984 --> 00:08:12.230
.adaptive parenthesis,

172
00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:13.063
minimum

173
00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.860
to 240.

174
00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:17.850
Great this looks much better

175
00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:21.460
and we have a better use of the space available to us.

176
00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:22.910
Let's add a little bit of padding.

177
00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:25.050
So .padding parethesis.

178
00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:28.630
Then we can add a title for this list.

179
00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:30.970
So right before the lazy grid,

180
00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:35.833
we're gonna set text parentheses latest sections.

181
00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:41.800
Then we're gonna set dot font weight to semi bold.

182
00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:42.647
Let's also add

183
00:08:42.647 --> 00:08:44.907
.frame, parenthesis,

184
00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:49.080
max width .infinity,

185
00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:52.753
comma, alignment .leading.

186
00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:57.970
And after the frame, we're gonna set .padding parentheses.

187
00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:01.090
Now let's not forget to go back to content view.

188
00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:03.950
And for the size class compact,

189
00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:07.180
we're going to set tab bar parenthesis.

190
00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:09.890
So if you run your app on all three platforms,

191
00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:13.730
you can see that the title here is roughly aligned

192
00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:16.170
to the learn on the left side.

193
00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:19.393
And the iPhone has the tab bar.

194
00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:23.580
And the Mac is using the sidebar as well

195
00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:26.050
with the extra content that we just added.

196
00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:26.950
In the next session,

197
00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:30.130
I wanna show you how to set two types of navigation.

198
00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:32.680
One is using the navigation link,

199
00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:35.430
and the second one is to use the modal.

200
00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:37.313
So I'll see you in the next session.
