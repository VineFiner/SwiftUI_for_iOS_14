00:00:00,533 --> 00:00:03,200
(air whooshing)

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,023
(upbeat music)

3
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:15,100
- [Meng] Hi there, welcome
to my SwiftUI course,

4
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,300
section 17, today, we're gonna learn

5
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,550
how to set deeper
navigation inside our app.

6
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:23,500
So right now, if we tap
on any of these sessions,

7
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,360
it doesn't do anything.

8
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,340
We have a custom transition,

9
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,320
but we would like to have the ability

10
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,960
to navigate to each of these sections

11
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,870
by either using a modal or
the default slide navigation.

12
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,650
So let's scroll down a little
bit to find the content

13
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:43,180
that is right here.

14
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:45,210
Right after latest sections,

15
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,490
you're gonna find the LazyVGrid,

16
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:50,640
and we're going to Command
click on the course row

17
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,640
to embed in VStack and change
VStack to navigation link.

18
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:01,740
Let's add parentheses and then destination

19
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:06,390
for which we're going to set
course detail parentheses.

20
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:10,210
So the course detail requires a namespace.

21
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:14,830
And in our courses view,
we have the namespace,

22
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:17,740
which is already attach
to this transition.

23
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:19,800
So we'll have to create another one

24
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,380
to satisfy this requirement.

25
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:26,950
So let's type namespace, var namespace2.

26
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:32,520
Then let's go back to navigation link.

27
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,913
And this is where we're
going to input namespace

28
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:40,710
to namespace2, great.

29
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:43,570
If you resume your preview and
you scroll down a little bit,

30
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:45,520
you're gonna find that
these are great out.

31
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,950
And that's because for the
preview to run navigation link,

32
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,070
it needs the navigation view.

33
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:54,350
But in this case, it is available

34
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:57,100
from either the sidebar or the tab bar.

35
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,630
And we didn't include that
here in the courses view

36
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:02,870
because we didn't want to
repeat the navigation view.

37
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:06,600
So we'll have to test that
in the device directly.

38
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,130
So when you run the app,
it includes a tab bar,

39
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:11,150
which has the navigation view,

40
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:14,520
and therefore the navigation
link will work as well.

41
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,220
So when we tap, it's going
to do this default transition

42
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:20,770
where you can swipe and go back.

43
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:22,940
Now the navigation
link, just like a button

44
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:25,400
is going to try to tint your content.

45
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,440
So you're gonna have to
set a color for the text,

46
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,090
but also if it's an image
which we already did,

47
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:33,770
set it to rendering mode original.

48
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:38,170
So back in courses view, let's
command click on course row,

49
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:41,880
jump to definition,
and then for the title,

50
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:46,880
we're gonna set dot foreground
color, set it to dot primary.

51
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,860
Now this is the color
already set by default,

52
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:53,010
if you haven't set anything,

53
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:57,360
but also if you use the navigation
link, it takes priority,

54
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,510
which means you're gonna have
to set the primary color.

55
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:03,030
In other words, this is a system color

56
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:07,160
and in light mode it's black,
in dark mode it's white.

57
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,240
For the secondary color, it
has different tones of gray

58
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,360
for light and dark modes.

59
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,210
Now for the modal presentation,

60
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:16,900
we're gonna go to course detail.

61
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,923
Let's resume our preview.

62
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:23,500
Then we'll select the course row.

63
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:27,560
Then we'll add a new
modifier called dot sheet.

64
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,050
Now in the second option you're gonna find

65
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:32,950
is presented content.

66
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:37,700
So is presented is a boolean
and content is the destination.

67
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:41,120
So let's set the boolean after endif.

68
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,120
Let's type state var show modal

69
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,250
is equal to false by default.

70
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,860
Then going back to the sheet modifier,

71
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:54,880
we're gonna set is
presented to show modal,

72
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:58,120
and don't forget the
dollar sign in front of it.

73
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,720
This means that it's a binding.

74
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,840
Now for the content we
can write it this way,

75
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,610
or we can just remove the
comma with the content

76
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:09,550
and curly braces and put the curly braces

77
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,670
after the parenthesis.

78
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:15,140
And here we're gonna set the
destination to course list.

79
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:17,630
Next, we're gonna have to set the action.

80
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:22,363
Right after dot sheet, we're
gonna set dot on tap gesture.

81
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:27,250
Again, we can make this cleaner
by deleting the parentheses

82
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,090
and then curly braces.

83
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:34,090
We're going to set show
modal is equal to true.

84
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:37,780
Now, if you resume your
preview and click on play,

85
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:41,180
since the modal doesn't
require a navigation view,

86
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:44,000
you're gonna be able to test
it right here by tapping

87
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,960
on each of the course row.

88
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,660
And this is the default
behavior, you can scroll,

89
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:53,700
but also you can swipe
from the top to dismiss it.

90
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,600
Please keep in mind that it
looks a little bit different

91
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,790
on the device.

92
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:01,930
If you go to the full screen
mode and tap on the course row,

93
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:03,590
it's gonna show the modal

94
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:05,480
with a black background underneath.

95
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,700
Another thing to keep note

96
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,860
is that if you're using the modal,

97
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,850
you're gonna have to keep
an eye on the corner radius.

98
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:15,550
To solve that we can set
the iOS corner radius

99
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:19,883
to 10 instead of 22, so
this will solve our issue.

100
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,520
Next I wanna show you
how to dismiss the modal

101
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,000
using a close button,

102
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,070
but first we're gonna create a new view.

103
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:31,690
Let's press command + N to
create a new SwiftUI file,

104
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:33,540
select SwiftUI view.

105
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:37,760
We'll name this course section detail,

106
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,313
targeting iOS and macOS.

107
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:44,350
Let me show the preview.

108
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:47,080
Then I'm gonna start right
away with a close button.

109
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,780
So close button parentheses.

110
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:52,050
I'll put this to the top right.

111
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:55,400
So Command, click on
it, embed it in VStack,

112
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,623
set to ZStack instead,

113
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:03,740
then parentheses after,
alignment to top trailing.

114
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:09,870
Now it's not gonna do anything
because the ZStack size

115
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,000
is this much.

116
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,040
So just like VStack, the
alignment applies to the items

117
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,960
in relation to each other.

118
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,040
Now I'm going to add some
content before the close button.

119
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:25,500
Let's start with the
course item, parentheses.

120
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,690
Now, because the course item
is taking the full screen,

121
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:32,270
the close button is
aligning against that space.

122
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:34,630
For the course item, I'm gonna set a frame

123
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:37,560
with a height of 300.

124
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:42,560
I'm also going to set a
corner radius to zero.

125
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:46,830
Then I'll put this course
item inside a Vstack first,

126
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:49,563
then change that VStack to scroll view.

127
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,190
After that I'm going to
put a bunch of texts.

128
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:58,190
So let's start with text
Command, click on the text,

129
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,050
embed in Vstack.

130
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:02,270
For the text, I'm just
gonna copy and paste

131
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,980
from my text content.

132
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:07,890
You can get this from
the design code page,

133
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:12,460
and at the end of the VStack,
after the curly braces,

134
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:16,520
I'm going to add a modifier
or padding parentheses.

135
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:21,520
And then for the VStack, I'm
going to add parenthesis,

136
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:26,600
alignment to dot leading
comma, spacing to 30.

137
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:30,680
Let's scroll down a little bit.

138
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,170
We're gonna find the close button

139
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:34,030
and let's add a bit of padding.

140
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:36,320
So padding parentheses.

141
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,110
For closing the modal,
we're gonna have to set

142
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:40,770
an environment variable.

143
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:45,310
So right before body, we're
gonna set at environment,

144
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:49,903
parentheses backwards slash
dot presentation mode,

145
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,240
then var presentation mode.

146
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,490
Going back to the bottom,
right after close button,

147
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:03,200
we're going to set on tap gesture.

148
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,410
And again, we can clean
this by just keeping

149
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:09,900
the curly braces and set presentation mode

150
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:14,350
dot wrapped value dot dismiss.

151
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:17,460
Great. Now we can go
back to course detail.

152
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:20,870
And this is where instead
of calling course lists,

153
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:24,630
we're going to use course section detail.

154
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:27,210
Now, if you test this on the device,

155
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:30,040
you're gonna see that we're
gonna go to the modal.

156
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,390
Everything works perfectly,

157
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:34,700
and the dismiss button
works as well, awesome.

158
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,280
There are just two things
you need to be aware of

159
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,430
for the Mac.

160
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:40,330
So going back to courses view,

161
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:42,540
we're gonna find the navigation link.

162
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:44,810
If you test this on the Mac,

163
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:47,210
so let me select this and run.

164
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:50,570
Navigation link is a little
bit buggy on the beta

165
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:52,550
and it has its own styling.

166
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:54,440
So instead of using navigation link,

167
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,880
I would definitely use a
transition that we learned earlier

168
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:01,820
with a preset or a custom one
using matchedGeometryEffect.

169
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:06,637
For now, we're gonna set a
condition so pound if OS iOS,

170
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:12,923
then after that else, and endif.

171
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,490
For the Mac, we're simply not
gonna use navigation link.

172
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:21,640
So just copy and paste course
row. Next issue is the modal.

173
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,380
So when you go to full screen mode

174
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:25,330
and you tap one of the rows,

175
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:29,020
the width of the modal is going
to use all available space.

176
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:31,950
So you're gonna have to
limit the width and height.

177
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:35,030
Let's go back to course section detail,

178
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:37,450
scroll to the very top.

179
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:40,440
We're gonna change body to content.

180
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:44,720
And before content, we're
going to create var body

181
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,770
of type some view, curly braces,

182
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:50,700
because body is the first
thing it's going to load.

183
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,450
Inside the curly braces,
we're gonna put content

184
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:56,350
and also we're gonna set
the platform conditions.

185
00:09:56,350 --> 00:10:01,350
So before content, pound
if OS iOS else, endif.

186
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,580
For the Mac, we're gonna set
content with a frame modifier,

187
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:15,580
parentheses with 800, height 600.

188
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:18,630
Awesome, so now we can go to the modal

189
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:21,453
and it's going to be 800 by 600.

190
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:23,810
In the next session,

191
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:27,580
I wanna show you how to set
the nav bar and the tab bar

192
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:31,558
to be underneath this
full screen animation.

193
00:10:31,558 --> 00:10:36,450
As a result, we won't have to
set a custom large title here,

194
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:39,300
and we can use that nav bar.

195
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,460
Likewise for the iPhone,

196
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:44,360
the content is going to
be above the tab bar,

197
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,410
which is a lot nicer.

198
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:48,589
So I'll see you in the next session.

199
00:10:48,589 --> 00:10:50,433
(upbeat music)
