00:00:06,044 --> 00:00:08,794
(soothing music)

3
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,810
- [Meng] Hi, and welcome to session 18

4
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:16,440
of my swiftUI course.

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,300
So today we're gonna learn
how to animate this view

6
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:23,130
above the sidebar, and also the tab bar.

7
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,550
As a result is going to
be also above the navbar,

8
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,300
which means that we won't have

9
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,430
to create a custom title anymore.

10
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:35,470
And we will be able to
use this sidebar toggle,

11
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:37,030
which is on the navbar.

12
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:40,090
Now back to Xcode, we're
gonna go to navigation

13
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:42,200
and we're gonna go to content view.

14
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,390
So right now if you're on the iPhone,

15
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:45,780
it's gonna use the top bar

16
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,510
otherwise on the iPad, the sidebar.

17
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:51,780
What we're going to do
is to put both of them

18
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,690
to reference courses view.

19
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:00,060
As a result, courses view will be managing

20
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,680
the sidebar and a tab bar.

21
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,090
So let's go to courses view.

22
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:07,020
Now here we're going to
create a separate instance

23
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,150
of the sidebar and the top bar,

24
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:12,080
and it needs to reference the content part

25
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,240
of the courses view.

26
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,680
First of all, we're going
to click the top menu

27
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,150
to find the full content.

28
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:21,180
And here, let's double
click the curly braces

29
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,910
to find the end, and right after that,

30
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:27,990
let's type var tab bar camel case

31
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:30,870
of type some view, curly braces,

32
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:34,040
then we're gonna go to
the top bar dot Swift,

33
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:38,023
and we're going to copy
everything, including the tab view.

34
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:43,480
So copy, go back to courses view

35
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,830
and paste that inside the curly braces.

36
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:50,220
Now for the first item,
instead of courses view,

37
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:54,310
we're going to reference content, great.

38
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:56,180
Let's do the same for this sidebar.

39
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,950
So double click on the curly braces

40
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:02,650
and right after that type var sidebar

41
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:06,030
of type some view curly braces,

42
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:08,290
then we're gonna go to the sidebar,

43
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:12,800
and for the content, we're
going to copy the list,

44
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,260
including the list style modifier,

45
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:20,260
then go back to courses view,
paste that inside the sidebar.

46
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:23,870
So just like the structure in the sidebar,

47
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:28,870
where we have the navigation
view, as well as the content,

48
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,820
we're going to do the
same in courses view.

49
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:35,830
So come on and click on
List, embed in v stack,

50
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:38,563
change v stack two navigation view.

51
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:44,550
Then after the list style
modifier, we're gonna put content.

52
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,740
Now we're also missing two
modifiers for the title

53
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,470
as well as the toolbar.

54
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,650
So we're gonna go back to the sidebar,

55
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:55,840
and here in the body, right after content,

56
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,980
we're gonna copy, navigation
title and toolbar.

57
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,660
And then go back to courses view,

58
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:05,140
we're gonna put that after
list style, so that's it.

59
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,090
And the reason why the
sidebar is a little bit

60
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:10,520
more complicated is because
of the platform condition.

61
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,920
Now the sidebar and the
tab bar has to be here

62
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,500
because we are referencing the content.

63
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:19,300
Once we have this setup, we
can go back to the very top.

64
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,530
And this is where we're
managing every view.

65
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:25,580
So right now it's simply
calling the content directly

66
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,520
and we're hiding the navigation bar.

67
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,950
Instead of doing that,

68
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:32,760
we can reference the tab bar directly.

69
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,780
Now what is interesting
here is that the Z stack

70
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:40,210
is stacking the tab bar
underneath the full content,

71
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:43,360
which means that the full content
is going to animate above,

72
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,030
so, if we resume the preview,

73
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:48,700
you will see that when I tap on any cart,

74
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,710
the tab bar is underneath now.

75
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:54,550
And because of that, we can use the navbar

76
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:58,530
and we can also remove
the custom large title.

77
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:03,393
So in content, let's
remove the text element.

78
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:07,670
And right after scroll view,

79
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:10,230
we can put the navigation title.

80
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:15,230
So after z index dot navigation
title, set it to courses.

81
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:19,500
And because of that, when I scroll,

82
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,650
you can see this navbar and the animation

83
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:25,250
is going to be on top without a problem.

84
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:28,220
So what's left to do at this
point is to make it work

85
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,310
with a sidebar for the iPad.

86
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,740
In order to detect the
largest screen on the iPad,

87
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:37,300
we're gonna have to set the
environment, so at environment,

88
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:42,200
parentheses, backward slash
dot, horizontal size class,

89
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:48,640
var horizontal size class.

90
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,450
Let's set the platform
condition so that this code

91
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:56,437
only runs on iOS, type pound, if OS, iOS

92
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:01,060
then after that, and if.

93
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:04,970
Next let's go to body
where we reference tab bar,

94
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:08,850
we're gonna set if horizontal size class,

95
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,176
equal equal compact, curly braces,

96
00:05:11,176 --> 00:05:15,310
then we can put the tab bar.

97
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:20,310
Else, we can reference
the sidebar, awesome.

98
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:25,423
So now we can test this
on the iPad 11 inch.

99
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,130
And voila, we have exactly
the same UI as before,

100
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:33,200
except now we're using
the navbar, but also,

101
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,860
the animated fullscreen
is above the sidebar,

102
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,783
and the tab bar as well.

103
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,040
Another big advantage is that

104
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,460
now that we're using the nav bar,

105
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:48,370
the sidebar toggle is now always present.

106
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:50,900
One last thing we need to
do is to test for the Mac.

107
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:55,900
So let's select the Mac and
try to build it Command + B.

108
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,390
Now it's giving us an error.

109
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:00,400
So let's look at it and here it says that

110
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,330
the navigation bar trailing
option for the toolbar

111
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:05,010
is not available for the Mac.

112
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:07,460
So even though we're not using the sidebar

113
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,730
from the courses view for the Mac,

114
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:11,480
it is still running the code.

115
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:15,120
And that's because in
content view for the Mac,

116
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,930
it's going to sidebar first,
and then from sidebar,

117
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:23,930
it's running courses view,
which happens to have this code.

118
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:28,130
So in this case, we can just
set a platform condition,

119
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:31,920
pound if OS, iOS and then at the end

120
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:36,330
of navigation view, and if.

121
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:40,640
Let's not forget to add
view builder for sidebar.

122
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,730
Great, now we can run the code.

123
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:45,830
And the Mac App is working
perfectly just like before,

124
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:49,100
but this time without
the custom large title.

125
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,640
In the next session, I wanna show you

126
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:55,210
how to add reusable components
and modifiers to the library

127
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:58,690
so that you can easily
insert them from the menu.

128
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:00,827
So I'll see you in the next session.

129
00:07:00,827 --> 00:07:02,669
